An original story for The Office according to chatGPT,"I typed, "" Write a an original story set in the world of the TV show The Office"" into chatGPT and I got the following:

Title: ""The Scranton Scandal""

The Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch is in the midst of a crisis. Jim, the branch's top salesman, has been accused of embezzlement by a former employee. The rest of the office is in shock as they struggle to come to terms with the news.

As the investigation progresses, it becomes clear that Jim is innocent and that the accusations are nothing more than a smear campaign by a rival company, who wanted to take down Dunder Mifflin. Jim rallies the office together to clear his name and prove his innocence.

Meanwhile, Pam is struggling with her own personal crisis. She has been offered her dream job in New York, but it would mean leaving her husband, Jim, behind in Scranton. She must decide between her career and her marriage.

In the end, Jim is cleared of all charges and the rival company is exposed for their deceit. Pam decides to stay in Scranton with Jim and the rest of the office. The Scranton branch emerges stronger than ever, united in the face of adversity.

Throughout the story, the audience will see the characters of the office trying to navigate a difficult situation, showing their intelligence, creativity, and teamwork to overcome the scandal, proving that Dunder Mifflin Scranton is not just a place where people work, but a family.

It's important to note that this is a fictional story and it's not related to any episodes from the original TV show.

Some observations after watching the UK office SPOILERS,"Honestly don't understand how people who love the US one can't tolerate this. 

Also, they butchered uniting Jim and Pam as a couple, when Tim and Dawn finally got together it made sense that would help Dawn gain the courage. The note with the medal honestly was so sneak in comparison. I feel like they were trying to make scene as emotional as that and failed.

The UK versions of Todd Packer, is even worse than Packer, it might even make anyone who loves Todd Packer  realise what a twat they are.

Garret who is the UK version of Dwight is really hard to like.

David Brent is like a mix of Michael and Andy, is hated more than both by his employees even though he really doesn't do anything as bad as either of them.

Who was the most competent employee on the show?,"Hey fellow Dunder Mifflin Nard Dogs/Pamalama-Ding-Dongs/Da belle of da balls

The Office is a obviously a show with a lot of goofiness and characters who just have interesting quirks and lots of characters screw up throughout the series in various ways and look foolish (and endearing) but in the midst of it there do appear to be some very smart and competent employees.

Michael Scott, despite mostly being a well-meaning clownish idiot for much of the series, has generally shown great flair as a salesman the few times he steps into the bullpen and his branch numbers from around the 3rd season onwards after the branch is in trouble following the mandate for downsizing seem regularly strong according to David Wallace.

Dwight seems to be the best salesman and seems to get the highest numbers most of the time. Oscar generally seems very solid and is very smart as well. Darryl also seems to know what he‚Äôs doing most of the time and good at his occupation, whether in the warehouse or upstairs.

-the next scene is in the break room, but Pam and Kelly still never actually see the phone. The phone screen can be vaguely seen being on a screen to send a text for these scenes.

-He sends the ""decline"" text and instantly gets a response as if he texted himself

-Phone stays closed while planning to go to Florida with Pam

-He flashes the text conversation to Dwight and Andy for literally 3 seconds to get into the Florida team. By then the text shown to them could be renamed to be from literally anyone.

I think I now know why I hate Karen so much,"Lately saw many posts saying Karen was a real catch and Jim was wrong for leaving her. But I don't feel that way at all, all scenes with her in it were kinda unsettling to me, and I think  I can now explain why:

Karen pretended to be someone she isn't to be liked by Jim. The most obvious example for this is when Jan got fake boobs and Pam was joking about that with Jim. When Karen noticed, she immediately copied Pams behavior and pretended as if she also now noticed Jans enhancement. She didn't do this because she actually found it funny, she did it to get attention from Jim and make herself more likeable for him. She pretended to be someone she wasn't just for the sake of their relationship.

That's the problem. And that's also the difference between her and Pam. Pam does not have to behave differently in front of Jim to make him like her.",Robo--FED,10cki00,15,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/10cki00/i_think_i_now_know_why_i_hate_karen_so_much/,DunderMifflin,1673791001.0

What is the episode that you always skip during re-runs?,"For me, it is S6e14 The Banker where the investment banker comes to check in on the office. He speaks to Toby about liabilities in the office and the whole episode is just flashbacks of bits from previous episodes put together. I don't find it funny to look at all the bits back to back and they're not as funny as the original episodes because they lack the context. The whole episode just feels like a drag and I always skip it.

I'm halfway through season 2. I hate Michael. Does he get any better?,"Hey first of all, this is obviously just my opinion, and if you like him, that's totally fine.

I just finished the season 2 Christmas episode. S2E10.

I just don't have fun watching any scene with Michael in it. He's such an unfunny cringy asshole. 
I don't know if it's just my past experience with terrible bosses but I absolutely despise him. I don't think I've laughed at anything he did so far.

Does he grow up or nah? Does his joking style change? 95% of his jokes are at the expense of someone, the other 5% are at his own which I also don't enjoy much.

I like everyone else, especially Andy and Toby, but sadly most of the show is centered on Michael.

Just wondering if I should keep going. Other shows I enjoyed: B99, Good Place, Community, Arrested Development.

It's annoying that they couldn't film an episode in Scranton but NBC sent the Parks and Rec cast to different states and countries.,"Rewatching Parks and Rec for the umpteenth time and it's nuts where the cast was sent even for some one off joke. Off the top of my head there are episodes with them in London, Scotland, Paris, Chicago, Indianapolis, The Grand Canyon, Washington DC, and San Francisco. The Office had Steve Carell in NYC (who was probably there for something else) and John and Jenna went to Niagara Falls....and that's it. And NBC wanted to fake that but they fought for it and agreed to send a very small crew. 

9 years worth of episodes and not a single one was filmed in Scranton but Parks and Rec did 2 episodes at Lucas Stadium. I wonder if the cast of the Office were ever annoyed that they were in front of a green screen pretending to be in Florida or filming in downtown LA standing in for NYC then find out a Parks cast member is walking around the actual location like London or Paris.",SarcasticGamer,10buqsv,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/10buqsv/its_annoying_that_they_couldnt_film_an_episode_in/,DunderMifflin,1673719057.0

Evaluating the characters too much?,"Hi folks!

I suppose I might get a lot of downvotes for this post but it's been too long

Why people here are evaluating the show characters and their deeds so much? Like, Jim/Pam/else is good/bad for this and that, etcetera. First, nobody is absolutely good or bad (and the categories are subjective) -- both in the show and irl. Second, it's a show, the characters cannot possibly be as consistent as people irl!! A lot of plot lines are built around Jim/Pam/Phyllis/others doing shit. I'm not sure it makes sense to expect very consistent behavior of characters in light of this. 

Finally, again, it's a show, relax, don't take things so seriously! No need to be morality police all the time.",danish_tart,10bb4od,13,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/10bb4od/evaluating_the_characters_too_much/,DunderMifflin,1673658092.0

Dwight the enigma: how competent is he really?,"He capably puts wrestling holds on Nick and Gabe, yet he gets humiliated by Michael. Later becomes a ‚Äúblack belt‚Äù out of pity.

He is the best salesmen in the company, yet he is entirely useless when selling to women and often verbally abused clients when getting bad news.

He paintballs all the time and offers lessons, yet when fighting Michael they both just kinda run in circles.

He claims to be efficient and effective (and his numbers show it when he was acting manager under Jo) but he also implements time wasting rules for the sake of authoritarianism (like a 30 digit copier code).

He capably runs a beer farm w/tractors and yet he crashes the forklift immediately and wastes a whole day failing to load a truck.

Questions from a newbie,"Hi everyone,

Just finished the series. And needed help figuring stuff out.

1- How did Angela fake the results of the paternity test the first time around and then admit the Philip is his son later on?

2- How come Dwight doesn't recognize the stripper at the restaurant even though they interacted quite a bit at the office and warehouse?

3- Is there a way to access the superfan to episodes for those that don't live in the states?

To me, even before he got sent to anger management and he was a douche at least he was entertaining to watch. And then when he came back he was actually a pretty decent guy for the most part until the writers dropped the ball with him (on purpose, it would seem.) I think he brought a lot of entertainment value to the show and that it wouldn't have been as good without him. 

Plus he had one of the most wholesome scenes in the entire show when he and Erin were in the junkyard and he looked at her almost in awe and said ""You're the nicest person I've ever met.""

Robert California's list in s8e1 is actually a good read on each character,"For reference, [here is the list I'm talking about.](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/theoffice/images/9/94/800px-TheListTheOffice.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20111213091547)


He separated them based off who he thought were winners and losers. After looking at the list, most of it is accurate with a few surprises snuck in, but overall I think its a good read on each character. 

One-by-one going down the list. 


**Winners**

**Jim** - While he starts off the show lazy and complacent, he grows throughout the show in both his professional and personal life and strives to be more. He even starts his own company doing something he loves by the end of the show. Easy winner. 


**Dwight** - Best salesman and the most loyal right hand man out there who eventually becomes regional manager. Another easy winner. 


**Oscar** - Definitely the smartest in the office and an overall good friend that Kevin and eventually Angela both love, even if he comes off as a know-it-all. 


**Darryl** - Another smart and dedicated worker who is eventually promoted and leaves for something better. Even if Michael refused to see potential in him, it's clear he has it. 


**Andy** - This is the first interesting one, because if you remember the episode, he starts off on the winners list then in the middle of the episode gets erased and put on the losers side. I think this is a perfect metaphor for his character. On paper he is a smart guy, but in reality, he is not all he is cracked up to be. He comes from a rich family, graduated from Cornell and is clean cut and oozes success, but he consistently has the worst sales in the office and doesn't take his job seriously (especially when he went on the boating trip in season 9). Even in his love life, at first you root for him and Erin, but then you start rooting for Erin to leave the relationship. Him being erased off the winners list and added to the losers list is just right. 


**Toby** - Although sometimes he appears checked out and is a nervous wreck sometimes (see the whole secret crush on Pam story line) no one takes more shit from their boss than Toby yet he still had the cojones to come in every day and face a boss that was incredibly rude to him. 


**Phyllis** - May not be the best salesman, but she is the mother figure that everyone seemingly loves. How many people confide in her when they have a problem? 


**Angela** - While she comes off as rude, abrasive and cold hearted, you can't deny that she is a damn good worker. In s4e17, when Michael is at the job fair and Jim is at the golf course, everyone else in the office leaves except for who? Dwight and Angela! You can't take away her integrity. Also, there are two blank spaces on the losers side, I wouldn't be surprised if Robert California marked her as a loser at first because of her cold demeanor and switched her to the winners side. 


**Kevin** - This is another interesting one. Kevin is the exact opposite of Andy. Kevin appears to be the slowest and dumbest person at the office, but its obvious that people see something in him. In an episode in season 6, Michael admits to Erin (I think it was Erin) that Kevin interviewed for a warehouse job, but Michael hired him as an accountant because he saw something in him. Even after Kevin is fired by Dwight, he opens up a bar and by all accounts from the show, a successful one at that. It's also interesting that there are two blank spaces on the losers side of the list, I'm willing to bet that Kevin was one of those names that Robert California took a second look at and decided there was more to him that meets the eye. I think this theory is even further supported by the fact that Kevin is the last name on the winners list. 



**Losers**



**Stanley** - He is complacent and inattentive to anything going on. Constantly doing crossword puzzles instead of paying attention. Not hard to see why he would be a loser. 


**Gabe** - A nervous wreck who lets Jo dictate his life and walk all over him. He is most people's least favorite character and a clear loser. 


**Kelly** - Keeps going back to a guy who hates her and breaks her heart consistently who pretended to want to look for a c-suite role for a bit but never had any real drive to make something of herself and married and quit her job at the first opportunity when she married (or dated?) a doctor. 


**Ryan** - He show drive at first and then regressed when things got tough and rode off of Michael's kindness and love for him and got complacent in staying at the same job (if he even had a job there) for years. I think the whole corporate experience hurt Ryan more than he will ever admit, even to the point where he keeps going back to Kelly where its familiar, and it has unfortunately turned him into a loser. 


**Old Man (AKA Creed)** - Delirious and possibly psychopathic old man who was supposed to be fired in season 2 but swindled his way into keeping a job. He was also responsible for the inappropriate watermark drawing on all of their paper in season 3.



**Pam** - Another one that I find interesting, but I also agree with. Pam may have grown a lot as a character during the series by leaving Roy and marrying Jim, but her professional life hasn't been as productive. She spent 5 season as a receptionist, she tried to become something more by attending art school but flunked out. She was promoted into bigger roles, but did she really earn these promotions? She left Dunder Mifflin to become a salesperson at Michael Scott Paper Company, which most people knew was a stupid decision, but was able to return as a salesperson. And before you call that a success, remember she failed at that job too and had to swindle her way into becoming an office administrator. These dishonest tactics is what got her a spot on the losers section.


**Meredith** - Someone who slept with a guy for supplier discounts, is an alcoholic and by most accounts a terrible mother to a boy who eventually becomes a stripper. Not much else to say. 


**Erin** - While I find her friendly and her childish charm endearing, it feels like she is the least professional and didn't really show drive to be anything greater. She is also easily infatuated with people like Andy, Gabe and Michael. If she was one of the seven deadly sins, she would be lust. Robert California may have bought into the childish charm at first, because there is an empty space in the winners section, but once he realized there was not much else behind that charm, he switched her to the losers section.

Finished the show for the very first time!,"1) I think I got emotional attached to it and I'm gonna miss it. Does this happen to anyone else? Although I'd definitely re-watch.

2) The last two seasons seemed odd to me and I did miss Michael but the last episode felt wholesome. It needed more Michael though, he should be with the others when they were gathered in the office after the wedding.

3) Did anyone else feel like it was too much Jim-Pam-centric? Like they were the main characters all of a sudden.

- Angela/Phyllis/Meredith/Stanley : I think I'd just say hello and ignore them

- Kelly : I would date her but get exhausted quickly

Over Dec and up to earlier this afternoon I binged The Office,"I never watched it when it was aired, not a single episode, but it was something I was aware of as it was such a huge cultural phenomenon.  Looking for something new, I watched the first four episodes, but didn't think it was all that great. A week later, I watched the fifth episode and that was it, I was hooked. 

I finished it off earlier today, and I am absolutely wrecked. I don't think I've ever watched anything that celebrated the true joy of living just a normal life like it did.

AITA for eating a hard boiled egg at my desk for lunch?,"One of my coworkers is pregnant. She and her husband, another coworker and all around idiot, made an announcement today regarding her touchy stomach due to her condition. It seemed to be an honest PSA, but it was actually very condescending and judgmental. I mean, I deserve the right to peel my hard boiled eggs at my desk. As an aside, another coworker mentioned her daily cigar and that she didn‚Äôt want to give that up either; so I‚Äôm not the only one upset by this. 

Anyways, I decided to eat my egg anyways. I mean, how can one person - a failed art student - dictate what the top salesman can and cannot eat? I was enjoying my egg, and she ended up puking a little bit in the trash can by her desk. It didn‚Äôt stop there. Another one of our salesman (who doesn‚Äôt even know how to protect people from bears) started puking too. Then the air-headed receptionist puked, followed by one of our accountants - who I think may have been a drug mule. Pretty soon everyone was puking. 

I know this isn‚Äôt my fault, but twinkledee and twinkle-dumbass seem to blame me.

help with EP duration (streaming divergences),"I only met the office in 2018 and watched the whole series in the same year

&#x200B;

now in 2023 I decided to watch it again however I see some Ep duration differences

&#x200B;

I researched here and it seems that there are 4 types versions

&#x200B;

*  The one that aired on TV weekly on the NBC channel
*  The DVD version that was released after each season ended
*  The dvd and bluray version with all seasons together with some deleted scenes and commentary   
   by actors and directors
* the peacock version (superfan) that came out now in 2021 on NBC streaming where all ep have   
   extra scenes and most that had 22min rose to the 32min range

&#x200B;

I want to exclude the Peacock (superfan) version from the discussion and focus on the first 3 versions that I quoted

&#x200B;

Searching here about it I saw that the first season is all right on all streaming with all 6 ep lasting 22 minutes

&#x200B;

In the second season that starts the problem, ep 5 Halloween of the second season on IMDB says it has 30 min however on streaming services like VUDU and AMAZON it says it has 22 min

&#x200B;

In the third season, ep 7 Branch Closing on the IMDB site says it has 30 minutes. On the other hand, the AMAZON streaming service has 22 minutes while VUDU streaming has 30 minutes.

&#x200B;

Charles Miner Theory,"Given that Michael and Charles met previously in the NY corporate office and got along great, my theory is that after that meeting, David Wallace and the rest of the higher ups took Charles aside and told him that they thought Michael was a screw up and they only kept him around because of his consistent numbers.  Charles, being the brown noser he is later exposed as, decides it's in his best interest to sever the friendship with Michael, so as not to be tainted, and try to ""whip him into shape"" and make him more professional in order to score brownie points with Wallace, et al. Eventually, the adversarial relationship completely destroys any sympathy he may have had at the beginning and with Michael constantly undermining everything Charles tries to do, brings out his wrath because he's trying to prove himself to corporate and Michael won't cooperate in any way. 

I think at the meeting in NY before he was pulled aside, he genuinely liked Michael.

Jim is extremely predictable.

Business Meeting plot hole,"I'm doing another rewatch and in the episode 'Business Meeting', Jans tells Michael that their meeting with Christian (played by Tim Meadows) should take no longer than an hour.

After picking up her car from the office Jan heads back to New York, calling Michael  (as evidenced by the fact that he asks her ""how's traffic"") at some point during the two hour drive.

Why would Jan have booked a hotel room for a business meeting that she fully anticipated would only take an hour or so? Especially since it's supposed to be a lunch meeting, she would have had plenty of time to do the hour long meeting and the two hour drive back to NY and still arrive back at Corporate before the end of the work day.

Gritty The Office reboot. Hear me out.,"The year is 2032. Gen Z is just reaching the age where they realize being an adult is the worst, so they try to cure it with nostalgia. 

This reboot will attract lots of eyes and dollars, so like everything else it will be ruined by capitalism.

Starring: Larry the cable guy as Michael Scott. 

Scenes will be interspersed with commentary by an AI hologram of Richard Pryor (brought to you by Pepsi)

It will air on HBO, So there will be some nudity. The full original cast will be naked at some point, no CGI or body doubles. Steve Carrell will appear as a pizza delivery in a sort of throwback episode.

You will feast your eyes on Naked Stanley, is what I'm trying to tell you. Naked as the day he was born, with a pretzel and a mischievous look in his eye. 

I'm open to more ideas to flesh this out, but my last idea is that Roy shoots Jim, and he's in the hospital for a whole season during the trial to convict Roy for attempted murder, which the whole office attends to testify, to hilarious results.

Season 6 really isn‚Äôt good.,"I know this isn‚Äôt news, but my wife and I just finished it in one of our many rewatches and it is a huge mess. It has no ambition. It doesn‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a season about Jim and Pam getting married/having a baby, if it‚Äôs about Sabre, if it‚Äôs about Michael sleeping with a married woman, if it‚Äôs about Sabre printers blowing up, etc. There is so much that happens and none of it is all that interesting. I remember watching it when it was brand new and not liking it, but I thought I‚Äôd go in with an open mind this time around. Well, I still don‚Äôt care for it.

All of these massive flaws could be forgiven if the season was funny, but it isn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not saying it doesn‚Äôt have its moments, they are just few and far between. Steve Carell looks like he‚Äôs got bigger fish on his mind - he literally has his Dinner for Schmucks haircut in a few episodes, thus proving he was quite busy at the time - which means that the rest of the cast has to step up to the plate and the writing does not support them well. The supporting cast is quite annoying in this season and it‚Äôs clear because they have to do a lot of the heavy lifting.

I was reading about this season last night and I learned that comedy legend Greg Daniels, who was a driving force of the first five seasons, had a limited role due to him focusing most of his time on Parks and Recreation. That makes sense because this is where The Office started to go downhill and Parks and Recreation was beginning to take off.

Questions for those who have the set!,"I can't mention the name as my previous post got removed for mentioning it, but I got the *cough cough* block set for Christmas and absolutely love it! For others that have it, I want to ask two questions:

1. Do you find it weird that there's no Andy? We have his desk and the hole he punched in a wall, but no Andy figure.
2. What is the silver ""5"" thing in Stanley's drawer?",EmmetyBenton,100pzdc,4,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/100pzdc/questions_for_those_who_have_the_set/,DunderMifflin,1672598216.0

Michael's Poor Dental Hygiene,"The show appears to establish that Michael has subpar oral health (references below) but I'm curious if there are any examples that I'm overlooking.

* Michael has ""soft teeth"" - The Dinner Party & Moroccan Christmas
* Michael only brushes his teeth for 10 seconds - The Injury
* Michael has bad/coffee breath - Performance Review
* Michael doesn't have dental insurance - Broke",PassyunkHoagie,100o7dp,6,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/100o7dp/michaels_poor_dental_hygiene/,DunderMifflin,1672593495.0

After watching the Superfan episode of Dinner party I think Jan and Andy might have been perfect couple.,Just saw more of their interactions in this episode and they kinda vibed without realizing it.
