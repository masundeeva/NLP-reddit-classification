office,"What Would You Do? Hello everyone!First time posting here.I wanted to describe this situation at my work, without dragging on too much.I started as an admin assistant at an office and I was the only office staff amongst 4 providers, running the office while my boss was working in a different state. We started getting really busy with insurance and one of our other providers needed an assistant so my boss hired a medical assistant. She has more experience than me in regards to insurance and has knowledge in those things that I admit, I definitely had no knowledge of, and I have learned a lot from her. I trained her for our office and our policies and how to schedule, etc.We have been working together for less than a month, trying to split the work and my boss sits me down and let‚Äôs me know that once she has the hours to give, she will be promoted to manager. That definitely upset me because I saw myself in that position in the near future. I definitely would‚Äôve preferred to not train my superior, especially not the role I‚Äôm interested in. I guess I‚Äôm mostly upset at how she went about it. "

office,"Do you have any office-related wisdom to share with a young person unfamiliar with the culture? Hey guys,I am a young 23M who last year through the right connections, was offered a part-time position in a small (6-7 people) office that manages events at a university. My role is roughly 75% in-person client ""babysitting"" and 25% administrative (Paperwork, excel, emails, etc.)My boss is taking a leave of absence next month and I am being offered the chance to fill in for him while he's away. I come from retail and have never worked in an administrative role, nor do I have a relevant uni degree. I'll be in over my head and I know it, but I want to come into this temporary role as best I can. My question is, how do I function as one of these people? I've already had a hard time adapting to the ""Corporate speak"" that seems to be prevalent in email chains for God knows what reason. I want to ensure I hit the ground running and do the absolute best job I can so I can build my case for a promotion after my boss gets back.Any advice is more than welcome, and I would appreciate your input!

office,"Starting to resent coworker.. I (F22) work as a customer service rep in a private airport base. I work with three other ladies, two are 50+ and the other is 20 and my friend outside of work. The coworker in question we‚Äôll call ‚ÄúLISA‚Äù. I want to begin by saying my managers close friend/ the offices accountant told my boss to not hire Lisa due to her terrible attitude and negative presence. This was before I got there. So already people don‚Äôt get along with her. So apparently when she got hired, it was known she had a job already but the agreement was she come at 10‚Ä¶She has another job so she does 4-9am there and is supposed to be at work by 10. EVERYTIME she comes no sooner than 10:30. Even reaching wellll after 11. One time I had to pull a 12 hour shift because she came so late and blamed it on her other job.When she comes in she always has Dunkin despite being late as hell. She doesn‚Äôt answer the phone unless I purposely don‚Äôt answer it because she waits for me to pick the calls up knowing I only let the phone ring once. Her work ethic sucks. She calls out last minute/comes late and doesn‚Äôt tell me knowing I‚Äôm going to be alone the whole shift. The job is light but the thing is I can‚Äôt eat, pee, look at my phone quick etc. I have to stay ears distance from the phones and incoming flights. She doesn‚Äôt say hi or greet anyone in the office and I sit at the counter with her. Literally me and her in the lobby together for four hours since I come in at 6-2. Everyone in the office knows not to even say hi to her cause either she won‚Äôt respond or will give a weird half butt hi like the person is bothering her by saying GM?? I even stopped taking initiative to speak so we won‚Äôt like at all. If I have to leave early I tell my boss and I leave and won‚Äôt say anything to her.My boss brought me in the office two months after I began to tell me I need to stop being late 5-10 mins. And the same for my coworker. I understood that but allowing someone to come hours later with ZERO consequences in the same breath is crazy. "

office,"workplace worries I work in a big room with cubicles. Three different departments (it's relevant). My coworker in my department sits two spaces ahead of me so there's one cubicle between us. It's important to mention that I am neurodivergent. Lately she has taken to chewing ice. I get it, it has no calories and cuts down on munching on candy. But it's so loud I can't focus. Let alone the fact that a speaker is on the wall behind me, it's too much going on to make my brain focus. I've talked to my manager and she knows there's been beef between us two. I used to be across the aisle from ice lady but moved willingly due to the fact that she makes such random noises and narrates what she does. The music gets shut off 5 minutes before we leave. She was really chomping on her ice this afternoon. I basically ran to my car to have a panic attack. I can't stand to hear any kind of eating sounds. Help please! "

When he comes in for the day, the first 30 minutes he's there they drink coffee and eat cookies and talk. They also live together so it's not like this is the only place they see each other. My management doesn't care, and if I ever bring up how distracting they are, I am looked at like a whiner.They can be incredibly unprofessional, using profanity loudly while I'm working with customers at the front or while I'm on the phone, and they have an app that makes fart sounds that they think is hilarious. I've had issues with them in the past, they are very rude people who will make your life hell if they decide they don't like you,  and they use very ""mean girl"" tactics. Why does no one else care?

Nevertheless, I did notice that he/she has a good rapport with the other 3 employees. This employee is new to the company by the way.I'm thinking about exchanging my desk with him/her. That way he/she will get an opportunity to build the rapport. I got no issues with moving to his/her workstation. It will be far from my current desk, however I feel I will have less distractions so I think I will be able to focus on work better.

office,"How to create a happy workplace?  you know that 59% of the Indian workforce is unhappy with their workplace?Let's look at the factors that contribute to this statistic. They include Basic needs- In addition to salary, employees require support in terms of healthcare, insurance, etc. Employees tend to be unhappy or dissatisfied when such needs are unmet.  Autonomy- Unhealthy power dynamics and exploitative relationships lead to unmotivated employees.  Mastery- A work environment that does not provide the resources or environment for employees to learn and grow leads to a decline in motivation or interest to persist.  Belonging- Lack of community or comradery within the workplace can make employees feel disconnected and lead to increased absenteeism. Now you may have heard about the workplace culture at companies like Google and Microsoft. They are known to create a safe, comfortable, and engaging environment for their employees. There are various benefits associated with a happy workplace. For instance, happy employees are great assets to the company as it leads to improvement in productivity, professionalism, and commitment. Further, the workplace motivates employees to go above and beyond as they perceive the organization's success as their own. Finally, there is a sense of belongingness and a strong community that forms as a result of a cooperative and safe workplace. "
office,"How to deal with a micromanager I've been at my new job for three months now. My last place of employment pretty much handed out task & trusted their employees to get it done with very little interference. This place, not so much. I get asked the usual ""Hey, how's it going"" quite frequently through out the day. I figured maybe it is because I am new & they're making sure I am getting adjusted. There is one coworker in particular who feels the need to hover over me whenever she hands me a project. She acts as if we don't know how to do our job. She's at my desk every 20 minutes. She sits behind me but she's constantly turning around to ask me Captin Obvious questions. I'm suprised her neck isn't hurting from looking over her shoulders all day. If I look through my purse, she turns around. My phone vibrates, she turns around. I rattle a plastic take out bag, she turns around. Then she complains she can never finish HER work. Here's an idea. Try minding your own computer screen for a while, hush for a few hours, trust your coworkers to handle their part & you just might get some work done. Ya just might. She's not my manager or supervisor. She wasn't even introduced to me during my interview. To make matters worse, she tries to give me useless tips on how to use the program to go about doing my job. She doesn't even know how to use the program effectively herself. She often asks me for help troubleshooting. She doesn't even have the technological know how to update old out dated software. We told her to update but she scoffed at us as if that's not the problem. She calls herself helping at times but she ruins the files by using the out dated system. A small tasks takes longer now thanks to her. I keep copies on my desktop just in case she opens & corrupts something. I design things on the computer btw. Its annoying to interrupt mid way through designing to tell the person how to go about making it. Its a creative process. Its like asking a baker to see the cake decoration while he's blending the cake batter. She is the type to tell him what blender to use instead & what temperature to set the oven. The only way to keep her from constantly being over my shoulder is to say ""I'm working on it. I'll let you know when it is done"". I have to repeat the magic words a few times before she temporarily disappears. Sometimes I wear headphones as a hint to DND but it doesn't work. She'll find a book or a peice of paper just to get up from her desk & be disruptive. Plus I also wear headphones because these people listen to the same playlist of golden oldies from the 1960s everyday for the three months I've been there. The introvert in me is going mad. I find myself hanging out in the bathroom just to get away & to calm my nerves before I blow up on her. I've had some irritating coworkers before but this is the WORST I've ever encountered. From browsing the company's server, my position has a high turn over rate. Gee..wonder why. My friends & family suggest I talk to the superior in our department. Someone suggested I ask to move my seat. I would LOVE to but the office is small & all the work stations are taken. I may document the times she is at my desk just so it won't seem like I'm ranting to just to rant. I am going to start job hunting but in the meantime time, what can be done to keep this annoying person from being an over bearing micromanager. "
office,"Bathroom Disrespect How do I subtly/nicely/passively tell a coworker to clean up after herself?I have a coworker that leaves behind horrible messes in the bathroom. The messes are so gross, that many people walk three flights of stairs to use another restroom when they encounter the messes. With a fear of being too graphic, she ""slimes"" the toilet seat and leaves behind long pubic hairs. I will never fault anyone for the smell they leave behind in a bathroom because that cannot be controlled; however, we have bathroom spray available and she does not use it. Lastly, and this is another thing you cannot really control, she leaves huge smears in the bowl which could be addressed by double flushing. Mostly and mainly- the body fluid and hair on the toilet seat are what bothers me the most. Most times I wipe the seat off with a clorox wipe when I encounter the mess, but I really feel like I shouldn't have to. Isn't it common courtesy to clean up after yourself? Yesterday the mess was so gross, that I just walked three flights of stairs to use another bathroom. People do that often around this building. Our workplace has 6 women and a really nice, clean restroom. It's a single bathroom, so you're able to lock the door and have privacy. It's so blatantly obvious who is leaving the mess, but everyone just sort of deals with it or talks about the issue behind this woman's back. No one has ever confronted her about it. I'm at a loss of what to do. I don't want to post a passive aggressive note in the bathroom, but confronting this person would be so uncomfortable given the subject matter. What can I do? "

office,"Smelly coworker Ever since winter started, one particular coworker who sits behind me started coming to work with a very strong smell. I‚Äôve even did a little experiment; it seems that on Mondays and halfway through Tuesdays, he will smell relatively normal, but as the days go on, the smell increases to the point that it literally smells like cat poop by Friday. On Fridays, my productivity level is the lowest because I simply cannot focus anymore. My hypothesis is that due to the cold, he only bathes on the weekend.My other desk neighbors all suffer as I do but none of us actually say it out loud. We just put diffuser perfumes on our desks and exchange glances to each other when the smell becomes significantly strong. I feel like I get the worse of it though since I am directly in the way of the ventilation flow which passes by him first before going through me. Also, unlike my other colleagues, my work requires me to sit longer in my desk while the others have more onfield jobs. I am the only girl in this area of the office though, and am also not that close to any of my coworkers so I don‚Äôt feel comfortable bringing this up to the other guys. This particular smelly coworker is also quite isolated from the others due to him being a foreigner (I‚Äôm also a foreigner but I‚Äôve been here longer). I‚Äôm not sure whether I‚Äôm the right person to just go up to him and tell him that he smells. I‚Äôve considered leaving him an anonymous note, but I‚Äôm not sure whether that will just make the matters worse. I really don‚Äôt know what to do or who to turn to here. Any suggestions? "

It helps but not nearly enough, it is to the point I smell it constantly but it is most strongly in the office when she is here. I have always been sensitive to cigarette odors but I think with the colder weather in our area she has started smoking in her car making the issue that much worse.

I am not sure how to get this resolved with no ones feelings getting hurt but it is to the point I do not want to come in.I smoke weed in my off time, but I do so in different clothes and not on my breaks or before work and I have always tried to make an effort not to smell when I go out in public and I rarely if ever smoke in my car, I don't want my car to smell. I am having to take shorter breaths and it is just awful. I don't want anyone to think I am being fussy because of it but the smell makes me feel so ill.

office,"Colleague asked me to take meeting notes AFTER the meeting I'm wondering if this is something that's normal, and just never happened in my old role, or if this is a weird request. I also want to make clear that I'm not complaining, I'm definitely showing my inexperience!  I just want to know if this is usual practice! We had a team meeting yesterday to talk about strategy. It was a productive meeting, but I noticed that one of the PIs wasn't taking notes. In my old role (and I'll admit it's the only office job I've had before this one. I was there for 4 years), whoever was taking notes would be asked to do so before the meeting started, so they knew to take notes in a way that's able to be shared later with the team. I wasn't asked, and given that it was an internal, fairly routine meeting with everyone present, I just took notes for myself, like I usually would. Then, about an hour after the meeting, the PI, who hadn't taken any notes, emailed me to ask if I could share my notes with him so he can distribute them to the other project teams. I'm happy to do this, but I want to ask him if he'll let me know before meetings if he wants me to take notes, so I can take better ones. Is that a reasonable request to make? "
office,"People who message you on Teams at work but just put ""Hi [Name]"" and then wait for you to respond So I'm pretty busy at work and I sometimes get a Teams message from people I may not know about something they think I might know the answer to. Anyone else annoyed when colleagues just send a message saying ""Hi [Name]"" and then don't actually write anything more?  Like you've just interrupted me and now you're not going to say anything else?  I know they're probably waiting for me to say ""hi"" back but I just want them to get on with telling me what they want.I know it's petty but it's even got to the point where I don't even respond unless they send a message with what they want from me.  It's bad enough when they send a message with just ""Hi [Name]"" and then send the next message separately but when they send a ""hi"" and the wait for me to respond before they get into what they want.  Quit wasting my time and get to the point.It might be a lot to read in one go but when I send a message I will put the hello in the same message I ask for what I want (like I'd do in an email), mostly so I don't have to wait for them to respond to then keep writing but also so it's just done straightaway and they can respond when they want to but at least know straightaway what I want and aren't waiting for me to come back if they respond and I've gone away because then I'm just irritated wondering why they couldn't have just asked me a question outright off the bat.  Fuck social niceties, just get on with it.Really annoys me. "

It seems like a great price. so I asked if it was in good working order and what the number of total copies was on the machine. They said it was in good working condition and that the DF71 punches, staples and sorts. It also acts as a de facto office mailbox system too (for faxes coming through would be my guess.)They said the total number of copies made was 1,120,693. With the drum life being 500,000 and rated for use of up to 85,000 copies monthly. I figure at $100 it may not have a significant amount of life left.. but the price is fairly low. It was under a service contract until they closed their business and it‚Äôs not in use except to test it recently to determine that it is still working and to prepare it to sell.Based on what info I‚Äôve got and provided here. What are peoples thoughts? Is this a worthwhile purchase? Better to try find a used copier with less total copies on it?The purpose for this would be primarily for printing zines (yeah, old school style zines), graphic design and editorial layout projects.So probably relatively low volume to medium volume. Well below the 85,000/monthly copies the photocopier is apparently rated for.Thanks so much for any input folks. "

My coworker knows this because I've mentioned it several times, and I talked to her about it, and asked if we could compromise on a heated blanket or something. She was open to it, I bought her the best heated blanket I could find, she said she loved it...and she doesn't use it. Something about getting skeeved out when it touches the floor. And I literally cannot dress any lighter than I do under the dress code.It's upsetting because I looked out for them, but now that the ""solution"" is uncomfortable for me, they don't seem to care. They come to the office in relatively light clothing, heavier clothes aren't worn anymore, they just use the heater, but I can't get away from it and there are no ""mini AC"" units (because thermodynamics).

Most of my work was based on displaying dashboards and meaningful business insights. Earlier the person who was working on this didn't give me all the information about how the data pipelines and everything was set up. So because of this, I don't know much of the stuff that is at the core level. I never bothered about the stuff because I was never told about how important the stuff is. So recently some issues occurred and our client was unable to see the data of the latest app version which was released in the last month. Later we came to know that the issue happened because the newer app had their IDs changed for which we didn't have the checks placed. Had I known about these app IDs before I could have spotted the issue well before and could have prevented the huge loss of data from the past one month.Also my manager is furious about why I don't have the complete knowledge about the ins and outs of the data and pipelines in place. I am really worried that I will be fired because of this. What shall I do? "

office,"How to handle office slander I am 6 months old on a job as a junior, working as an external with a big corporation (going to become internal next year). I have made some initial minor mistakes on the job, learned from them, and gave better results to my team over time. However, a person on the team (who is an internal, 4 years in the corporation; also new to the team but comes from a different department and less productive than me; always going on holiday) is recounting my past mistakes to the other teams I work with directly to get my work done, and now they think that I am inherently incompetent, even if I am doing my best to facilitate the team's work. The person in question has only verbally gossiped about me and made me look bad in front of others and now they feel unsure about the efforts that I put in. Meanwhile, this person is also spreading misinformation within my team, telling people that the other team (who I just mentioned) is unhappy with the work that I put in. When I confronted the other team about this, they confirmed that they don't have any formal complaints against me, only some minor points of improvement and 1 of them even told me that they can see that I am trying to do my best. At this point, I am considering approaching my team manager and disclosing this dynamic, as it could put the team's productivity at risk (as my work relationships are getting jeopardized). I don't have concrete proof (as all this happened verbally between the person and the question and the teams). Even if the team manager denies my credibility about the situation, I feel like he should know the team's work and productivity are under threat because of this dynamic and person. I only have one trusted source about the gossip, who is also a junior, and I am afraid that he would refuse to go on the record for me. So I am really all by myself in all of this... My biggest concern is that I will be seen as a newcomer troublemaker as I don't have concrete proof, and no one by my side to testify for me, and eventually get fired to protect the person in question who is internal.

office,"Help on restoring MS Word file So I was working on a research paper, on word using my MacBook air m1. Due to the nature of this device, I rarely shut it down, only close the lid.Autosave was on, and the file was on a OneDrive synced folder.Today when I was done with the bibliography of my work, I tried to save the document to the onedrive folder where it has been sitting for over 3 weeks. Upon pressing the save button, an error about saving failed because of insufficient memory appeared. After that, word closed and reopened and offered to restore from a recovered file. I agreed, and to my despair, it restored to an old backup, around 1 week old, loosing almost 100 hours of work in one swift move. The newly restored file has no version history and it's autosave feature is toggled off.Only then I became aware the onedrive app had crashed days ago without giving notice. When I opened the OneDrive app again, my account wasn't even on it, and it prompted to enter my user credentials again.So far, I tried:-Restoring previous version from word itself; the option is greyed out in the menu-Looking inside automatic recovery folder; first, it was different than the folder location indicated in several tutorials, and secondly, it sits completely empty, even when toggling the view for hidden items.-Accesing MacOS TMP folder; no luck finding the file there.-Restoring from Time Machine; I hadn't activated it on this Mac.-Restoring via third party software; the file appears only in its current unfinished state, the same as it was backed up to onedrive.After years of extensive use of OneDrive and MS Office throughout, never had I experienced such an error/bug that led to such an important data loss. Currently considering on never touching onedrive again.I'm open to suggestions on restoring said file / commiting autolysis. Thanks in advance. "

office,"Can being a top-performer cost me a promotion? So I have been interviewing for a new position at the company I work for. It is open for both internal and external applicants, and I am the only internal candidate. I was encouraged by my direct supervisor to apply because he thinks I'm being underused.After 3 interviews with different departments and 1 written task, I have one interview left with the head of my department. The thing is, I've heard from other people that he is hesitant to promote me because I am the top performer of my current team and if I moved to another position that could hurt the KPIs and leave a huge gap. I know for a fact that the rest of the managers believe in me and have provided the best feedback for my skills and work ethic.Do you have any ideas about how I can convince him? Have you had similar experiences? So far my main argument is that any external candidate would need a long time to familize themselves with the company's product and procedures, and that could potentially push back the desired results. But what if he's willing to sacrifice the position's objectives for some time if he views my contribution to my current team as more valuable?I would hate to miss out on an opportunity for a position I'm really excited about just because the big boss is scared that the rest of the team's performance will go down the drain without me "

office,"Was I wrong to ask my coworker not to talk about politics at work? I work from home now at the same place but this happened back in 2020 when I used to work full time in the office. Not to start a political debate here, but I have a coworker that's in her 60s, she's a huge Trump supporter and MAGA republican and she thinks Covid is a conspiracy. For a long time, our office was short staffed and my boss had to be gone for long stretches of time so there would be many days that I would be alone in the office with this coworker. During these times, she would go off on political rants. I didn't engage by expressing my opinions because I didn't want the work relationship to go sour. This person has been nice to me, I just don't agree with her politics. I listened to her rants for weeks if not months until it got to a point that it made me extremely angry. I work at a very small company so I asked my boss if she could meet with me and I explained what was going on. Myself and another coworker asked my boss if she could just ask everyone in the company in general to stop discussing these things at work, but she didn't. She said the company was too small for that and she made me confront my coworker about it directly. All I told her was that it just got too intense and I didn't want to talk about politics at work. She apologized and I thought we were fine after that. Well, I just heard from another coworker that she frequently makes comments like ""Well, I'm not allowed to talk about politics because OP doesn't like it."" I was honestly shocked by this. She makes it sound like I was being overly sensitive or something when really I just didn't want to hear it anymore. I try to stick with the policy of not talking about sex, politics, or religion at work. Was I in the wrong to say something? Should I have just sucked it up?

office,"Oh, and the client, too. I work for a major accounting firm in Canada, with dozens of offices across all provinces. Yesterday saw someone in an office in another province send out an email with some sensitive client information. How do I know this? Because the sender put a contact group as a recipient that included every person employed by the company in both the sender's province, as well as my own. Oh, and the client, too.But that's not the worst of it. 30+ people replied to the original email, saying they should not have been sent this email. How do I know this? Because every one of the 30+ people clicked ""Reply All."" So, again, every person employed in every office in both provinces were getting emails throughout the day from people saying they should not have been getting the original email.Oh, and the client, too. "
office,"Pulled in to the office. So I've been working here for 4 days. There is a picture of the original team on the hallway of the office. I asked who one of the people closest to the owner was since I didn't recognize him. The person told me his name and that he had been let go. Someone overheard that and told the boss. Things were a bit odd by day 3. 4 people disappeared. One of those people was training me so I asked if it was their day off. On day 4 i find out all those people got fired. Then I get called in and the boss says ""I hear you have some questions about Tim, the guy in the picture. I'm all about transparency, I want to know what you've heard and I want to answer any questions you may have about to."" I told him I didn't know anything about the guy since I just started but I asked about the picture and just asked who he was nothing more. He responded with ""is that really all you know. We are all about transparency so just tell me everything you've heard about Tim. We parted ways because he wasn't a right fit and that was that. Does that answer your questions about the matter?"" I said ""I just about the picture is all and the one that was training me since I thought he would still be training me. I thought if was his day off and now I see he's no longer here, so I was just curious since no one seemed to know where he was at the time. That's all."" To which he responded with ""ok so do you have anymore questions. In the future feel free to ask me any questions. I'll answer any questions."" So that's my fourth day working in an office for the first time.  Sheesh. From what I later learned. All the four people that were let go, including the guy training me, were all connected to Tim in some way. Apparently they were all trialed by him and from what the boss said, they learned bad habits from him. Idk this is really odd and I am going to just stick it out for a few months with this target on my back because I feel like I am not in the scopes view waiting for me to mess up and give them an excuse to get rid of me. Wish me luck today on my fifth day of working here. "

office,"Free snacks or not? I have only ever worked in two offices. One of them made snacks available for employees (as well as water, teas, coffee, etc.), the other one did not (just coffee and water). What do you think? What would be the best policy? (beside the obvious: ""Free stuff... yay!"")Office n.1 did not provide excessively junky stuff, it was usually very plain crackers, some cookies, just to get over the munchies. I never saw anybody take advantage of it, like going grocery-shopping in the office pantry... They would also offer drinks and appetizers on Friday after 5:00pm. I thought the snacks were pretty useful and having drinks with the bosses on Friday was a bonding moment (it was a short business, not an excuse to keep you in the office longer). But maybe I was just being bamboozled by a few snacks üòÖ Working conditions in the two offices were pretty much comparable otherwise. "

office,"""Your coworkers need to know you're working"" Is it normal for a workplace to have an open for all to see spreadsheet of productivity?We have a spreadsheet (which is largely self reported) that keeps track of what everyone's doing. Projects, savings, queue work, phone calls... everything.I'm used to some form of productivity report existing, but in the past productivity was between the employee and the manager.Ever since I started at this place, at my reviews, I've been chewed out for not projecting well enough FOR MY COWORKERS that I'm doing work.I need to speak up at the weekly meetings and give updates so my coworkers know I'm doing work.I dropped 1 goal category for a couple of days to focus on another goal category (which I projected would bring us in a lot of savings).... I got told off for not holding to the other numbers. Again ""Everyone needs to see you're working on this""The damn spreadsheet is largely self reported, and I'm more focused on getting things done than on updating it. My boss knows what projects I'm working on... he either gives them to me or I update him constantly... oh but I'm leaving a bad impression on our department head and my coworkers because what I'm doing isn't reflecting on the board.Is this normal?!Honestly... I can work... or I can keep up some sort of appearance, not both. And the stress of ""OMG Am I doing enough? Am I doing the right thing this week? Everyone is looking at me! What if this project doesn't tic the right box!!"" is really getting to me.It's the only complaint I've gotten the whole time I've worked here... and year in and year out I'm told my coworkers are going to think I'm being lazy.Or that they already think I'm being lazy.It's like it doesn't actually matter what I've done... because it wasn't quantified on the board in the right place at the right time it didn't matter..... so again... is it normal to be able to see virtually real-time numbers of what everyone's doing at any given time?

office,"Is it really that bad if I move job or team too often?! I joined my first ever cooperate job as a graduate. I did the program for a year and a half and I got a official offer in Analytics department. Our departments have several teams. I really liked the team I worked for as a graduate so wanted to join that team but they didn‚Äôt have enough head-count so I joined different team. Soon I found out I didn‚Äôt really enjoy the job I did there and applied for new role in different team (same department), got the job and started working in new team only 6 months after I joined that previous team. I knew this was a bad look so I am trying to stay at least a year in this team. But my pay became a little annoying problem. I found out that I was getting paid 3000 dollar less in my previous team comparing to Graduates who joined a year later than I did. That contributed to my team change and I managed to negotiate and bumped it up to reduce the gap to roughly 2000 now. I am waiting for performance review result and since I only joined the team 4months prior to the performance review so I am expecting moderate grade. This will eventually mean I would get paid roughly 5000 dollar less than graduates who joined a year later. Because of pay band, graduates who joined 2 years earlier and found the right team early, would already be getting paid 2000 more than I am now. This will eventually mean, I will be bottom of the pay band for another year, even though I worked in same department for almost 2 years (including graduate period). This really demotivates me and makes me want to move job. I understand I am new to the team so I worked extra hard, get comments that I don‚Äôt look like I am new. Seniors in my team ask me for advice for some of the things they do and I can explain comfortably which surprises me too sometimes. But still treated as if I am working as bottom of the pay band?I discussed it with my manager and got told it is what it is. Focus on self development and you will get there. 2000-5000 per year is nothing once taxed. I personally think it is matter of respect but was not negotiable. I am writing CV just in case I find something new but would this be a bad decision and look bad on my cv. I like the team and I like the work I do but money is just very demotivating. Money is not everything but it is something to me. But just to keep the resume nice, should I stay another year and move? It will be my 2nd year me getting under paid. I am not sure if I can mentally handle it unless it is for something. "

office,"Potential workplace stalker Hey guys.I am a 32 y/o female and I work in a real estate office in the marketing department. The door to the marketing office cannot ever be closed as the air conditioner system is dependent on that door staying open.About two months ago, someone stole my work laptop from my desk, along with a brokerage-branded pillow and hat. My coworker‚Äôs laptop, which was in the same office that we share, was left untouched. Both of our laptops were clearly visible, along with her iPad and personal laptop. I filed a police report and chalked it up to an agent unfortunately seizing the opportunity to gain a new laptop. This cannot be attributed to housekeeping, as it was taken on a Tuesday and they only come M-W-F.A few weeks later, the recycling bin that my coworkers contribute to (I turn it in and add the money to my savings account) was emptied. Again, this was done on a Thursday when housekeeping wasn‚Äôt here. I chalked this up to someone needing the money more than me, and silently wished them well.When I left the office yesterday, I looked at my full water bottle and though, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt drink enough water,‚Äù and closed the lid so that it didn‚Äôt get accidentally knocked over and spilled on my computer.When I came in this morning, my trusty water bottle was waiting on my desk for me, perfectly empty and with the lid off. Following the pattern, my coworkers belongings were untouched.In my four years here, housekeeping has never done anything like that.

office,"This is what happens when I go out with my coworkers I'm a person that likes to keep to oneself. I work in an office inside a Wearhouse with project managers and supervisor, etc. After a hard & chaotic work wave, my coworkers like to go out and celebrate a job well done. This usually means going to bar and having fun. I don't usually go since I have other commitments at home. BUT the last time I went, oh my god! it started out normally ,coworkers ordering drinks, talking about how we survived the work load, etc.  Once the drinks started taking affect one managers wanted to take photos with all the ""pretty girls"" from work, since it was rumored that he was well off, money wise, almost all the ""pretty girls"" he took a picture with said ""okay that will $XXX.00"". I first thought that they were joking but this man pulled a stack of cash and started paying THEM to take pictures! I was shocked.  I told one of my coworkers (who has been working for the company much longer than me) what had happen and she said that's normal. Some time pass and I went to the bathroom and heard my coworkers confessed to sleep with other coworkers and managers. when I came out the bathroom I caught one floor manager (married w/ kids) kissing and office clerk (single). when I got my table with the coworkers I was hanging out with, my ex-boss (story for another time) was drunk and giving ""good vides"" to another floor manager, next thing we know, guy almost fainted. Now rumors circled around work that he is witch/wizard. Office clerk confessed to me that he following day she only kiss floor manager out of pity and that he went for a 2nd kiss but she rejected him. Other stuff that happen was the typical drunk signing, drunk dancing, giving people rides home and a fight almost broke out. so yeah... "

Two hours a day. I am moving closer soon, but of course one way to work out of depression is to do the things you enjoy. I went to culinary school for fun -- cooking is one of the few passions I have. Here is the question : I HATE cooking for myself, it brings me no joy. But I live alone and obviously spend most of my time in the office  (I work in a manufacturing plant) --- as a woman in a male dominated industry, does it discount my professionalism or authority if I bring food into the office for my co workers to try?

office,"3 Reasons Why You Should Take Your Work Outside  Ever thought of working outside in a park, caf√©, or any other outdoor location? Most people argue that it is not a good idea to take your work outside. But working outdoor has a lot of benefits. It makes your mind fresh, improves your moods, shifts the environment from a boring office to something new, make your work a fun and much more. All these benefits indicate the same thing, productive work. In this article, we will tell you three main reasons why you should take your work outside.## 1. Lowers StressNo matter if you are working remotely or inside office premises, you will have a lot of work-related stress that can even double if you do not change your environment. Also, the workload itself just adds more to the stress level. Higher stress means less concentration on work, lower efficiency, and productivity. So, how to overcome it? The answer is simple to begin working outside.Go to your favorite coffee spot, order a latte, open your laptop, and start working. Along with refreshing your mind, it will also lower your stress by providing a different working condition. You can also invite your peers and team members to come for work-related discussions. Parks also make a good choice for lowering stress while working from home outside. As highlighted above, nature itself is a mood changer. Charge your laptop, go to the park, sit for a while to release your stress, breath in the fresh air, and then start working. You will work more efficiently, and your mind will be more productive. Try that.## 2. Improves HealthHealth benefit is another important reason why everybody suggests coming out of your [work pods]( and working outside. While working outdoors, employees move. It‚Äôs not like the office desk and table where they spend hours sitting in the same position.When outside, whenever you feel exhausted, you can easily walk, move, and do exercises. Movements will increase your blood flow, maintain heart rate, help you burn calories, and much more. It brings a lot of health benefits to the list. Plus, the sunlight will also improve the vitamin D quantity in your body. Ultimately, you will have healthier physic.## 3. Works As Positive Distraction Working outside brings positive distractions to your daily schedule. While sitting in your home office wood pod or office, your mind becomes exhausted. You hardly find any positive distraction being surrounded by work all the time. Just staring outside the window, feeling the fresh breeze, or even looking at the sky can be refreshing sometimes. These are some of the positive distractions that improve productivity and concentration on work. Sometimes, such distractions become necessary to work better.These are some of the key reasons why you should choose to work outdoors. If your mind still does not accept its benefits, then we suggest you give it a try. Take your laptop, go to a park, and work there. You will surely feel more productive, focused, and efficient and have a positive result. "

office,"How to Motivate Employees to Work Better? Depending on several factors, the productivity in your office could be decreasing by the minute. This could happen due to several reasons which are difficult to predict or even specify. To make your work easier, I have collected tips to motivate employees.## Tip 1: Listen to their needsWhat most employers miss is to listen to what their employees need from them or the work they are getting. By focusing your attention on their requirements, you will give them a feeling of being heard, which will motivate them to work better, put their best foot forward and boost their productivity.This will also create a sense of friendship and comfort between you and them.## Tip 2: Create a positive office cultureThe kind of culture you have in the office greatly depends on the employer. If the culture is productive but positive, your employees would feel more comfortable and at home. This would ease them up and inspire them to work more and better.## Tip 3: Keep a challengeIt is only human to get attracted to a challenge that will make you feel more alive and excited. IF you set up a small goal or challenge among your employees, you would be able to motivate employee performance to a much greater extent.## Tip 4: Keep fair payrollAnother way to keep your employees motivated to work for you is to reward them well. Make them feel comfortable like working in their home office. No one would want to work for someone who doesn‚Äôt treat them well or has or doesn‚Äôt value them. If you keep the payroll considerate and deserving, your employees would perform better and give you much better results.Above are my tips, how about yours? Let's share with me! "

office,"Noise-canceling headsets for office and multiple people calling or having meetings Hello! I need some help, I would love to hear from you guys. I am looking for some headsets to buy for my office. We mostly use Jabra and it is the easiest one for me to convince the company to buy but other brands could be possible too. Environment:We will sit 2-3 people (most of the time just 2) in the same office room. There are maybe 3+ meters between us. At times we will have calling sessions or video meetings together. Sometimes we will be in separate calls/meetings. Sometimes the same.   Problem:When I have a call, watching a video, or in a  video meeting, I can hear the other person in the same room talking and therefore cannot concentrate. If in the same meeting we have to mute our mics when the other talks. Requirements:- On-ear (My boss doesn't like overear, although I realize it could be more isolating if we went with that)- Wireless-  At least 2 device support - should be able to link up to PC (Lenovo Thinkpad) and Phone (Apple iPhone) at the same time so it's easy to switch. - Noise-canceling /ANC/ Microphone- so that we can have multiple conversations in the same room without hearing each other and that the person we are talking to doesn't hear other people.Like to have:- Jabra or a well-known brand. - Docking station - the current headset is the Jabra  Pro 9465. It has like a docking station that charges the headset. It also has a panel that you can use to click on to accept or decline calls and more. Also for video meetings when you take them off and put them on it automatically connects and opens the meeting.   At the very least it would be nice to have a charging station.-Comfortable - I assume all will be to some extent. But like what do call centers, control rooms, and others use? They have many conversations next to each other and I can assume they have the same needs as I described above.  What are we looking at:I am looking at the Jabra Evolve 75 MS. This only has a charging station, but as far as I can see fulfills all other requirements. The Jabra Engage 75 was a good option too but doesn't have ANC which I think might be too important to miss given the above requirements but seems to have everything else. There is also PNC (which I guess is instead of ANC) but I am worried about that not being enough.   What are your recommendations? "

A few minutes later (a while after that conversation thread was over) he asked why is one of my tasks delayed by such a long time period. I responded on the reasons behind the delay, although the reasons were regularly being communicated during our daily standups. The next day in our standup, it was communicated to the rest of the team that his task would be picked up by someone else. Some time later he asked the same question again about my task in front of the wider audience ... I shared the latest updates again including the progress made the day before, as part of my usual standup updates.But I know very well he is retaliating because questions are being raised on his task. And the tone of his questions relays the same as well.How do I handle such situations? And, he probably won't, but how to respond when he asks the same question again? "

office,"UX Designer to Product Manager I am a self taught UX Designer working for 3 years, and 7+ years in graphic design. I am 20. The company that I work for is a startup working on a healthcare platform. For the past two years they've reached nowhere, its been a total wastage of time and money. I was the only one who was doing something in that organization. The others just took for the paycheck. The team has shrunken from 60+ to 8 people including me.I discussed the problem with the CEO of the company who's working on building this startup, and discussed about all of the effecting factors where he went wrong, cuz I've been observing everything since the beginning. And I've also learned about product management. And I got some pretty good problem solving skills which I'm very confident about. So I told him to change my role from a UX Designer to a Product Manager. He agreed, but told that he'd title me only after he sees some positive outcome through my work in the specific period of time.I'm confident about me and my skills, but my co workers are absolute cunts. They've no knowledge about anything. They were assigned a task to collect info about emergency services, pharmacy, doctor consultation, pregnancy care, mental health assistance... and around 20 more things. What they did was... they kept pushing the deadline from 1 week to 2 weeks, then a month, and then 2 months, and stretched to 3 whole months. And what they presented was equivalent to a homework done by a middleschooler, or maybe worse. Nothing relevant, just filled the pages with some random copypasta.Two third of them got fired, and a few are still there. I know they're peebrains too. I've planned on a thing to reveal their actual abilities in front of everyone, cuz until now they worked in groups, and if asked about something, they said that they did it together and the actual person who was the unfit kind wasn't being caught. Now that I got the power, I know of the ways to milk them individually and leave them no chance for any excuses.What I wanna know is that how would I approach my employer to convey him for getting them fired... Cuz I know that if they stay around, this product is never gonna grow. They have no skills whatsover, and when I discuss some pretty basic things like card sorting or value proposition canvas, they waste most of my time in trying to CORRECT ME. Mind that they have no knowledge, they do it cuz of their ego, that I'm just 20, was 18 when I joined this company. They bring up stupid stuff. So I used to be a UX Designer here, and so the product must be according to the feasibility of the user ofcourse, for which I did the user research and created a user persona, now they poke their nose into it and tell me to design the userflow according to what they say and not the actual user, and they assume a bunch of stuff about the user. Which is big no no, when it comes to UX. You're not supposed to assume. They don't know shit.There were other professional guys too, but they got better opportunities and they switched.You might be wondering that why I'm still working here and not looking for a better opportunity. Actually I'm in college pursuing BFA in animation (animation provided the most things to learn of all courses). And I wanna continue my career in UX design by doing my masters in HCI in the US. Also, I need the security free loan (prodigy and alike) and scholarships, so if I maintain my position in one organization and make a change, I'll be having a strong thing to show off in my resume.I see myself doing it in this company, also the idea of this product can bring fortunes, all it needs is the right execution. I believe in myself, but I wanna get rid of this leeches who're stopping it from happening.Sorry if this was too much and unnecessary, I ranted :| "

office,"Best Office Layout For Two Desks You Should Try in Your Office The challenge of setting up a single-person home office is an easy one. But, what if you and a buddy, twin, sibling, roommate, or spouse want to design an office layout for two desks. Increasing numbers of individuals are working from home or freelancing thus this is a very convenient idea for many houses.When it comes to working in a shared space, an office layout for two desks is the best option for most households. It's better for your health and productivity to have a shared workspace at home. A well-designed two-person home office makes it possible for a variety of individuals with varying requirements to work together in harmony. As a result, there's even more motivation to think about what to do next.## Best Ways To Arrange Office Layout For Two Desks### Selecting Right DesksFor home usage, we don't advocate normal, cumbersome, and unsuitable desks. A standing desk for the home office would be a better and healthier solution. These desks may now be found in a wide variety of sizes, designs, and fits, making it simple to perform extensive research, while helping you set up an office layout for two desks. An adjustable standing desk may either be powered by an electric motor or manually operated by a crank mechanism.### Build Double-sided Shelved CabinetsThis is a good option for people who wish to utilize their current workspaces and facilities for their business needs. Consider utilizing the lowest shelf of a long cupboard as a work area if you have a lot of stuff. This is a reasonable assumption that the cabinet is wide enough to fit two individuals and their work supplies.### Get Good Ergonomic ChairsThe correct chair with armrests is essential for a comfortable sitting experience. The bottom section of the back panel should be curved to provide additional back support. Under the chair, the back panel, the armrests, and the base of an ergonomic chair are all places where the chair's adjustability may be found.### The Right SpacePeople have different preferences when it comes to their work environments. Some love to be surrounded by wide areas, while others prefer to take frequent breaks. When designing your space, think about your own personal preferences. If you're going to be taking a lot of breaks, make sure your dual office layout has plenty of open space. Position the workstation such that you can view the rest of the room if you require open areas. There is a workstation facing the wall and a window for those who are easily distracted.### Get Curved Desk PairingA curved desk is one of the most underappreciated office desk designs for two people. In the office, you're more likely to notice them, but at home, you're more likely to see them overlooked. They are, nonetheless, very adaptable. Employees should face one corner of the workspace while using them. "

The nature of our work is one that leaves no social time. We are a 24hr office so it is rare for more than a couple of people to have lunch at the same time. People come in to the office but must work in isolated booths. The work is time-sensitive so if employees are schedule on a task they cannot do anything but that.

Our schedule has now been optimized so much so that there is no time for colleagues to communicate, it has only, essentially, left them time for bathroom breaks. I worry about the mental health of the people I manage. I am new to management and this change just happened. I am struggling to find ways to retain staff/keep people positive.

What [kind of office design]( can you use for your business? We will guide and help you explore your choices to find the greatest office layout inspiration.## Office Layout Inspiration Ideas To Refresh Your Office:### 1. Cellular Office LayoutOne of the most common office layouts, the cellular office, is efficient. In this case, if you detect an increase in your employee's productivity. They are usually arranged in a sequential manner to ensure that each employee has their own personal area. As a result, employees are free to carry out their responsibilities in whatever way they see suitable. This design creates a workplace that is both focused and methodical.### 2. Coworking Office LayoutEmployees have the option of choosing where they want to work based on their own preferences. Workers or teams might be assigned particular work zones based on their responsibilities. Entrepreneurs that want to foster a sense of community among their employees would appreciate this office layout as inspiration for their place of business.### 3. Open Office Layout:These low walls tend to divide the whole floor area. An office standing desk is available for employees to use, but they may also opt to share one with their colleagues. Individual ergonomic seats and laptops are provided to all workers, regardless of whether they work in a traditional office or a virtual one.### 4. Low Partition Office LayoutInspired by the cubicle office layout idea, a low partition office is created. However, the walls in this layout tend to have a lower height than the cubicle form of workstations. As a result, workers are able to communicate and collaborate more effectively in this style of workplace structure.### 5. Hybrid Office LayoutHybrid work models provide a great deal of flexibility for businesses when it comes to arranging their workspaces. To put it simply: With a hybrid work schedule choice, you get the best of both worlds.You get the best of both worlds with a cellular and open office layout in a combined design. As a result, individual cubicles may be used to separate the space, but they take up less room. They also don't depend on doors or windows for separation in the hybrid work-from-home configuration. "

I‚Äôve endured it for two months, but am at the point where I can‚Äôt tolerate it anymore, it is effecting the quality of my work I feel.  Personality and management wise we are complete opposites.

However they will compliment what you‚Äôre wearing a few minutes later. They have been at the company for 20 years and are the most senior in that office.

Currently they are working with a team of independants and only a few actual hires of which i am one.So much time is lost by a lack of oversight. I notice people being surprised all the time by tasks and deadlines. And im in turn surprised by the lack of organisation in all these projectSince the budget is very limited right now I am looking for some free/cheap project management / event management tools that can help me out for the forseeable future. Preferably software that we will be able to upgrade to pro pack once there will be more funding, but that is usable in the free/cheap form.What im looking for is a tool that will allow me to create a timeline throughout the year, for the overall projects and to break those projects down in tasks with deadlines that can be assigned as tasks to people, preferably working with Outlook. Im guessing i want too much for the money that is (not) available but I also know many orgs (or more the people working in these orgs) struggle with this, so i'd not be surprised if this wheel is indeed allready invented. Im even condsidering just finding an excel spreadsheet to help me out here, but that sort of goes against my religion :D. "

office,"How to fix an unorganized and messy office building TLDR; Moved into new office and movers placed heavy filing cabinets and equipment in the middle of the building and there is no space to move it anywhere else.  I was hired about a year ago and before I started, the department I am in was moved to a new office, which is basically just like one of those school portables/double wide trailers.   It was a bunch of random people that moved everything so there have been filing cabinets randomly placed throughout the office blocking walkways and just getting in the way. Half of the files were also just randomly placed in different offices so a good part of my job the last year was just trying to find where old files were placed.    One of our offices is now the ""miscellaneous"" room that we have to keep closed.  Most of the cabinets are way too heavy to move and there are only about 2 or 3 of us there at a time and just don't have the ability to move everything.  I don't have the strength to move a 600 pound fire proof filing cabinet and some of my coworkers have injuries preventing them from doing any kind of lifting, pushing, pulling, etc.   Many of the files still have to be kept but it would take us weeks of ignoring our work to get this place organized and put together properly.   Does anyone have any tips on how to fix this or what department in a company would maybe be able to help out? "

I was initially hired as an intake to take phone calls at the small family run business i work at after my friend got me to work for here since its their company. They have 2 companies and I work at the other one and its really hard since its in the medical field and it can be tough especially as a full time nursing student who also works full time for them. Over time I saw how unorganized everything was here and how each worker here is always gone and doesnt come in the office on time (our work starts at 8:30am). The ""HR"" was the oldest son of the administrator and he is such an alcoholic and manipulator. I never told told them anything about him puking in the morning and him making do everything because he doesnt care. Up to he point that he got terminated on the day I was not at work. Now I'm always left alone doing HR, payroll/paycheck, intake, purchasing of our inventory and other stuff that was not in my job description. There are times that I would get 3 phone calls and i'm all alone in the office. Its super depressing and the fact that i'm only getting paid $18 an hour as the office manager is kinda shitty bc I didn't ask for this position and they just ""promoted"" me with no pay raise. And the sad part is because its a ""family"" business they hired back the oldest son but for the other company as if nothing had happen. I even told my friend who got me in this job that I feel used to clean up their mess and they always wonder why this company is so toxic. I was called fat and useless by most of the nurses or even the patient for little mishaps that I do like ordering medications even though theyre suppose to do that. I want to quit but I dont think theres gonna be another opportunity for me to work at the medical field. "

Instead of noting something nondescript like ‚ÄúHiring discussion‚Äù explain what should happen. E.g., ‚ÄúDiscuss whether to hire another marketer this quarter.‚Äù  Agendas should be as short as possible, but as long as necessary.  If you find your agenda is going on for multiple pages, it sounds like you have some information to share BEFORE the meeting. Move that content to another doc and send it as something to review pre-meeting.  Share your agenda Google Doc in advance of the meeting.

office,"Save your back! Top considerations when setting up a home office. I think one of the most important considerations when designing an office is the long-term impact it can have on your health. Additionally, my mom is a licensed Physical Therapist in Kentucky and many of her patients struggle with back pain. There is a lot of advice she has to offer to supplement her physical therapy, because recovery also requires a healthy lifestyle and I wanted to pass along her advice for setting up your office...For your desk chair, you need to know what actually matters when choosing a desk chair for your back. So ask these questions...Does the actual seat pan tilts forward? Of all the actual so-called features, this one is perhaps the biggest non-negotiable. You need to be able to tilt forward the actual angle of what you are sitting upon in order to properly execute the ‚ÄúHome Base‚Äù position of sitting on the edge of the seat. In this position, your knees are below your pelvis and you are sitting on the edge of the seat. NOTE: the ability to tilt the seat forward can also help reduce the knee pain that you often feel during long bouts of sitting. How does it do that? The angle of the chair better aligns your whole leg so that your patella tendon isn‚Äôt pressed against the back of your kneecap with the same amount of force.Does it have solid lumbar support? This will allow you to sit with your knees at the same level as your pelvis but with your back resting against your lumbar support. Ideally, the lumbar support is independently adjustable from the backrest. But it‚Äôs also fine if the lumbar support is adjustable insofar as it can move up and down with the backrest.Do you have the ability to sit in multiple positions? You CANNOT stay in one position all day.. So, besides supporting the two ‚Äúhome base‚Äù sitting positions, your desk chair needs to be able to support general adjustments in how you are sitting throughout the day. Side note: that‚Äôs the problem with rigid desks: you typically can‚Äôt raise your chair and sit underneath it.Does it have adjustable armrests? it‚Äôs important to be able to rest your arms or have them share the load throughout the day. So, armrests are a good thing. But, they need to be at an appropriate height and width from your shoulders so that you aren‚Äôt forced to slouch when using them. It‚Äôs also important that they are adjustable so that you can roll your chair close to the desk and have the chair be able to go under the desk surface.You can read the [full post here]( if you want to know all the factors you should consider.Second, here a few of the health benefits of having a standing desk...1.) You are able to switch between sitting and standing.If you‚Äôre working at a desk all day, this is the best way to put the least amount of stress on the spine. Here‚Äôs the logic: 1. Standing all day = fantastic for the spinal discs in your lower back but tougher on facet and sacroiliac (SI) joints. And it can also be hard on your feet (think plantar fasciitis).  . 2. Sitting all day = easier on your feet and joints but rougher on your lower spinal discs. 3. Conclusion: You need to switch it up.2.) It gives you customizable desk height for perfect posture.It‚Äôs pretty simple‚Ä¶Perfect desk height exists for the sitting and standing positions.Every person is different.Therefore, everyone‚Äôs perfect desk height is different and we can pretty much guarantee that your perfect desk height doesn‚Äôt fit a cookie cutter height like 30 inches ‚Äì it probably reads more like 27.385 inches.An adjustable standing desk is likely the only option if you want to have your desk at the perfect height for your back.You can read the [full post]( I wrote that covers the all of the benefits of a standing desk for your back and why you should consider getting one...Finally, If I've convinced you to consider prioritizing your health in your office decision, I literally spent over 50 hours scouring the Internet and researching the [best desk chairs]( and [best standing desks]( for your back.You will find tons of lists from all kinds of companies and organizations. Even news outlets like USA Today or the Chicago Tribune have their own lists of the best chairs and standing desks.So, I googled it.¬†Reviewed the lists.¬†And came to this conclusion: most of the ‚ÄúBest Desk Chair‚Äù or ""Best Standing Desks"" lists online are either bad or fake news.Here‚Äôs why:1.

office,"Small office: Cleaners during working hours seems a little disruptive I work at a fairly small company which has a small office building.  The company owner uses a cleaning service to clean the office once a week every Wednesday - Things like emptying the garbage, vacuuming the floor, cleaning the bathroom, etc.  The issue is they come to clean the office during the workday, which I think is a bit disruptive, especially if one of us is in an online meeting or phone call with someone, etc..  We do software development, so the type of work we do normally requires concentration.I have an online meeting every day at 4PM (which is a quick status meeting that usually lasts about 15-30 minutes).  Today, the cleaners happened to arrive right around that time and started vacuuming and making other noise right away, during my online meeting.Would it be reasonable to mention my concern about work disruption when the cleaners are here?  I'm wondering if it would be possible for the cleaners to come later in the evening when people generally aren't in the office.The company owner is usually here during the day, so I'm sure he must be aware of possible work disruptions.  One day I even heard the company owner mention to the cleaners that they had a phone call (presumably to ask them for some quiet).Some more info: Up until a few weeks ago, there was just one guy who came to do the office cleaning, and normally he'd arrive at around 5PM or shortly after.  While there was some disruption, I didn't think that was too big of a deal because any online meetings & such things usually end before then.  However, now there are 2 people who come to do the office cleaning, and they arrive anywhere between noon and 4PM.  They also take more time with the office cleaning (one thing they do is mop the floor, which the previous guy didn't do). "

office,"What Are The Modern Office Trends? Remote work is the predominant work model, but office work isn‚Äôt over yetRemote work has been excellent for many people, as it has allowed them to unlock their full potential while working comfortably in an environment adjusted to their needs. There are struggles, but an organized and clean workspace at home can help you become more productive and efficient.All companies use a different approach to keep their workflow balanced and constant even when more than half of their employees are at home. Despite that, many sources argue that working at the office is still necessary.It‚Äôs quite complicated to mimic the same level of collaboration, innovation and energy that we have during in-person meetings. While remote work can be beneficial for individual workers, multidisciplinary teams may experience more productivity, efficiency and less stress while working with their teammates at the office.Hot desking, office hoteling and other unassigned seats trends in the modern officeThe COVID-19 pandemic has increased our needs for collaboration more than ever. However, this same era has made us reevaluate how we meet at office spaces, which led eventually to the adoption of hot desking and office hoteling, to mention a few models.These organizational models imply ‚Äúunassigned seats‚Äù at the office, allowing each employee  access to the best area to complete their work at that specific moment. Furthermore, hot desking and office hoteling also imply different office spaces oriented toward co-working, like ‚Äúthink spaces‚Äù with atmosphere accustomed to the needs of the workers, such as blush tones.While this modern office trend isn‚Äôt new, it has become more common in 2022. According to studies, assigned desks are dirtier than toilet seats. So, besides being a more convenient option for most people, it‚Äôll be easier to maintain an organized and cleaner office space.Nature-focused office design for better air circulation and qualityThe benefits of bringing nature to the office are undeniable. For instance, studies say that keeping plants at the office can help you stay focused and productive throughout the day.

office,"New to the office scene... feel annoyed. So is it like a thing to just plop random information in an email with very little context and expect me to know what to do with it? Whenever I send an email I spell stuff out very clearly about what certain information is and basically explain the context and always open it up for questions.  Meanwhile, I get emails loaded with random acronyms and stuff and it's just confusing.  ""Here's the H-49 from last week's run-through. au23enenqai3424. Do you have the window?""The honest response to that email is "" What's an H-49? Am I supposed to be going to run-throughs? The window for what?"" (okay this is an exaggerated example but this is what it feels like)It's been 3 months since I started and there has been zero official training.. just "" ask if you have any questions "" but every time I ask I feel like they expect me to know how to figure this stuff out on my own... there's a wealth of information around me .. but it's poorly organized and basically as clear as the emails I get.Furthermore... I have caught on to some things... such as this request process we go through for getting clearance to access certain resources. But I have a super-senior lead person who tells me... ""contact so-and-so for access"" ... but I will go find the appropriate request code and come back with... is it just this request? and the senior will say "" yeah but you should contact the people I told you to contact anyways "" ... so I do.... and the response from the people he told me to contact is, ""you need to submit the request for access to this with this code"" !!!! I get really annoyed cause the person who's been there for 20 years is making me look like I didn't even learn how to do that part of the job right. This guy is all about "" contacting the people "" but he doesn't seem to get that him contacting someone creates a much greater sense of urgency than when I do.Then they're like... ask questions if you don't understand something... so yesterday I was being asked to do something that's not really in my job description but I kinda thought it was a good thing to know how to do... but I had a few questions so I sent thru our chat service the questions.. it was one question... then ten minutes later another... then a little later one more and I immediately get a phone call from this guy who's the supervisor of the guy who should have been doing this task and he sounded super annoyed and said "" you're typing a lot... what's going on? can I help""; I guess it's cool he's offering his help... but the initial tone really bothered me... I'm supposed to ask questions but also not really... that's just something they say to make it seem like they're being nice to the new people but when you do ask they treat you like an annoying little brother who can't tie his shoes.I've been remote the entire time and this is my first office job, so there are just a lot of situations I don't know how to handle. I'm definitely going to stop contacting people for access to resources even when a super-senior guy tells me so.I'm probably being too sensitive, but I needed to rant - maybe someone can confirm that this is a normal feeling being new somewhere or maybe someone can tell me that I'm fucking up in a certain way so I can get underneath it.The third - sixth weeks were so great! I had enough understanding of processes and my system set up finally .. and I was taking on tasks and completely understanding everything, and killing the tasks and getting praised for it. Then everything changed they shifted me to a different project and gave me more boring/complicated work... I don't know if I'm performing as well as they expected, but I definitely miss the easier work that I'm actually qualified for that I was doing before. "
office,"How To Become Top Performer At Work - Water-Walkers vs. Swimmers The following video guide explains a distinction between two kinds of performers on work: [Water-Walkers vs. Swimmers: How To Be More Successful At Work?]( Swimmer: A strong performer. Water-Walker: The rare one-of-a-kind hire who changes the trajectory of any company he or she joins.The video above provides an analysis of 6 behaviors that waterwalkers consistently do: When confronted with a severe business crisis, the waterwalker focuses all energy on how they will overcome the crisis and still deliver; the swimmer will often focus instead on doing a superb job of ‚Äúselling‚Äù a lower base. Waterwalkers consistently focus on self-improvement and asking themselves, ‚ÄúHow do I get better everyday?‚Äù Swimmers focus more on self-promotion and ask themselves, ‚ÄúHow do I sell myself and get myself positioned to get the promotion I deserve?‚Äù Waterwalkers make any assignment a great assignment; swimmers think success or failure is based upon having a ‚Äúgood assignment‚Äù. Waterwalkers always approach a topic from the standpoint of ‚Äúhow crisp and clear can I make it?‚Äù Swimmers tend to measure success by how long, how many charts, and how many numbers they can put on one page. They erroneously equate quality with quantity. Waterwalkers recognize the power of developing people as THE way to achieving their business goals; Swimmers tend to prefer to ‚Äúgo it alone‚Äù and consistently believe they alone must be the major driver. Finally, waterwalkers tend to be thinking, ‚ÄúHow do I change the game?‚Äù, whilst swimmers work on, ‚ÄúHow do I grow the business?‚Äù "

For example: she will pick her nose sans tissue, will rub whatever she gathered from her nose then flick it or will keep digging, she will also put her fingers in her crotch then sniff them YES you read that correctly, clip her nails, clean out her ears w q tips, will be making eye contact with you during conversation, then be looking at the q tip to see how much wax she cleaned out and proceed to go back for more, constantly sniffing her nose. The crotch sniffing and nose picking really gets me the most. I've had a nail clipping land under my desk but it could have been another co worker's clipping. What do we do?!?!

Their mom took action only until like 20mins later.

office,"I need the right words for this battle I need to have a serious conversation with my boss. I would love advice about what to say and how to say it. I started this job 6 months ago and I‚Äôm very qualified with many years of experience in this field. I work in the busiest most challenging branch of our entire company. It‚Äôs constantly stressful and I put out fires all day long. There is nothing I‚Äôm doing wrong. There are a lot of moving parts to this work and there are many things beyond our control that make this branch extremely difficult. I was warned about this even at my interview. I have new coworkers that have transferred from other departments that want to cry after their first day. They have told me that to say this branch is the most difficult is an extreme understatement. I have taken on the challenge. Every day I work my ass off. I put in all my hours and then some and almost never take a break. Not because I want to kiss ass. Simply because I really don‚Äôt have time. I try to make sure that I am doing my part and more to ensure things go smoothly for our clients as well as for my colleagues. Like I said so many moving parts and balls in the air. My immediate manager has a constant attitude with me.  She‚Äôs condescending and bitchy and I become a tongue tied mess because of how she is. So embarrassing. With anyone else I can hold my own and stand strong and I don‚Äôt know why I become a bumbling fucking idiot with her. My boss boss (above her) is very kind and goes out of his way to tell me what an amazing job I‚Äôm doing and how much they appreciate my hard work. My immediate manager worked my branch in my position before. Listening to her she makes it sound like she had it all whipped into shape and had time to twiddle her thumbs on top of it. Whether that‚Äôs true or not I know circumstances have changed and the branch has become busier and more complicated. We had some new people join our team and I knew right away the project they put together for this team was not going to work out. I saw the flaws from the beginning and told her this. She basically chewed me out and told me to stay in my lane (not in those exact words) and told me there was no reason they could not handle the new structure. 2 months later they scrapped the project and had to re-haul the whole thing just as I predicted. She‚Äôs reluctantly told me that we‚Äôre changing again without once admitting she was wrong or apologizing for her arrogance. The problem is she talks to me like I‚Äôm not pulling my weight. Basically I know she thinks I‚Äôm slow or inefficient or maybe wasting time by her tone and choice of words with me. When, honestly, I‚Äôm working my ass off everyday and everyone sees it and acknowledges it but her. When I tell her where I‚Äôm at in projects she responds ‚Äúoh so you HAVEN‚ÄôT done xyz??‚Äù. As if I‚Äôve been sitting around watching Netflix on the job all day. To top it off they want me to work on MORE projects. I have a hard enough time keeping my head above water with the day to day as it is. I‚Äôve had absolutely no ability to work on more things as much as I would like to. While people in other branches are working on projects all the time and climbing up the ladder in less than 1 year but their office circumstances are night and day from mine. Colleagues from other branches say they sympathize with me and offer to help ‚Äúwhenever I need it‚Äù just as sweet as can be. But when I have reached out for help or to delegate they have told me they are too busy and then cop an attitude if they actually have to do anything. It‚Äôs going to come to a head and I know it. We need to talk this out. But I know I‚Äôll make a fool of myself when I need to stand up for myself. I‚Äôm a damn 45 year old woman and this girl has to be at least 10 years my junior and she talks to me like I‚Äôm a child. It bugs the shit out of me. Please help me come up with the right things to say to get my point across Im overworkedThis branch is hell I put in 100% every dayNo Im not lazy. There‚Äôs just THAT much work I need help and I need her to understand that "

Some even say they can be contacted via email or chat, but then they're not online on chat.  Is this common?

High quality printing, black is comparable to laser printer.2. Printing does not plug, ink does not dry up. Use the special ink of ""continuous jet ink cartridge"", print automatically, vibrate, filter and clean, all ink is consumed, and there is no plug. The ink does not dry up. The built-in balancer of the ink cartridge receives the electrical signal of the ink cartridge printing and turns on the air pressure switch. When it does not print, the ink cartridge automatically turns off the air pressure switch to close the contact between the ink and the air. The ink does not volatilize and the ink will never dry up.3. Increased capacity. The average capacity of black ink cartridge is 25-30ml, which is equivalent to 5 times of the original ink cartridge. One ink cartridge should be used for at least 5 years.4. Printing costs fell sharply.5. No maintenance, easy to use. After you use the ink in the box, the user can add it at will, which is as convenient as pouring the water from one cup into another. After adding, it can be printed directly on the computer without maintenance.6. High efficiency and long life. After the modified ""continuous jet ink cartridge"" is processed by corresponding technology, the ink cartridge can realize long-life, high-precision printing and can be reused.7. Low carbon, environmental protection and green printing are in line with the global trend of energy conservation, emission reduction and environmental protection. "

office,"Do I have a right to be upset/annoyed ?  I got the crappiest gift out of the whole team and I actually find it quite insulting.

office,"Fresh out of college at 23... and struggling to transition to office life. Looking for advice and support I graduated in May 2021 with a BFA in graphic design. A bit of context, my whole family have worked in the public school systems, none of them have ever worked in an office setting.I now work in an office and it's been a tough transition amonog my fellow peers and I (Those I graudated with.)1. We all work at different companies but all of our companies, we find ourselves actually working overtime most days. Instead of a 40 hour week, it looks more like 45-50 hours salaried (No overtime pay). We are all stressed.2. I have struggled with ADHD most of my life but in the school system I found people were forgiving with feedback and little mistakes not so much in design post-graduation3. I'm 4 months in and the senior designer training me is suddenly gone-we don't know when he is coming back to the office. There are days where I really don't know the answers to questions4. In school I always made the deadlines on time and was punctual with my work, even in team and large scale event projects, and at my internship. But now at my job 2-4 people are always in my files and deadlines get complicated with sudden changes and late feedback.5. I feel like my physical and mental health are not doing their greatest. It's like a slow burn.6. Getting used to office lingo and business culture is really strange. People are indirect and sometimes I'm not sure if I understand them fully.7. My mom and family always sticked to one job, one place of work their whole life- that's because in the school system their pay was based off of the years they worked there, not completely tied to performance, I feel so stressed at my new place of work and always feel the need to step up and say yes to working overtime even when I know I shouldn't for that hope at a raise8. Most of my circle are in the same situation I'm in but for even less benefits and pay. I can't really complain as my workplace isn't toxic but I feel like I struggle a lot and put a lot of pressure on myself to succeed. It's so hard with adhd as I'm constantly missing tiny details or rereading things. If you've made it this far thank you for reading my vent. I miss college and didn't know what I had until I didn't have it anymore. :( Life isn't fair, but I wish 2 years of my college weren't flushed down the drain to covid, I would do anything in the world to go back and have one last good senior year before graduating, and I would do anything to have the senior designer that was originally training me back.

office,Defining Purpose at work  
office,"Do you think that Proactive Customer Service is essential? How could it be that just 13% of 6000 customers reported receiving proactive customer support?¬†Clearly, lots of service organizations are failing here. And there are many challenges to providing proactive service that cause this failure. But the three big ones are: Lack of executive, managerial, and/or employee understanding and/or buy-in. Improperly equipped and/or trained customer service reps.¬† Failure to create a proactive customer service culture.## 1-What is proactive customer service?You know proactive customer service when you see it.  If you‚Äôve ever gone in for an oil change (hopefully) you‚Äôve seen proactive customer service. Typically, the auto shop inspects your vehicle as part of their oil change service. This allows them to identify issues you might not know about, preventing more costly damage to your car. That‚Äôs proactive customer service.  The academic definition of proactive customer service is:¬†>An individual‚Äôs self-started, long-term oriented, and persistent service behavior that goes beyond explicitly prescribed performance requirements.¬†  In the auto shop example, it‚Äôs the organization that created the policy, but the concept is the same. Ideally, both individual actions and organizational policies align to enact proactive customer service.  ### Proactive vs. reactive customer serviceReactive customer service looks like agents who do what they‚Äôre told (and nothing more).¬†  Reactive customer service means solving the issue of the moment, not necessarily the underlying problem. Reactive service providers might follow directions well, but when something they haven‚Äôt been explicitly trained to handle pops up, they‚Äôll need help.¬†  This is also a very narrow view of the customer journey. Reactive customer support tends to focus on only the customer service issues directly in front of the support team, rather than pay attention to all of the areas where customers encounter problems and need to resolve issues.  A common indication that a customer service team is very reactive is when customers have to call in several times to solve the same problem. This isn‚Äôt a great customer experience and can result in consequences ranging from unhappy customers, to customer churn, to increased call center costs.  ## 2-Benefits of proactive customer supportTaking a proactive approach to your customer experience ‚Äî across customer calls, customer service tickets, and how you support new customers ‚Äî can lead to many benefits:  Dramatically reduce customer calls. By proactively communicating the solutions to common customer services issues, you can reduce overall support requests significantly.  More loyal customers. Exceptional customer service earns lasting customer loyalty. Proactive customer service offers more opportunities to resolve customer issues than reactive support.  Increase customer retention rates. Providing proactive support helps you prevent problems that would otherwise go unnoticed, causing customers to churn.  More brand advocates. In addition to improving customer retention rates, proactive support can also delight customers to the point of creating brand evangelists, bolstering the brand‚Äôs reputation, and helping recruit future customers.  Better customer data. Proactive customer service often results in better customer interactions, leaving customers more open to participating in the ways you gather feedback, such as with a feedback form or survey, so that customer service teams can better understand customer behavior.You can find more solutions to approaching making your proactive customer service better in your organization [here]( Feel free to comment below joining the conversation about any examples of bad customer service you've received or any proactive customer service you've witnessed!

office,"Teknion hiSpace Quick Connect Electric Height-Adjustable Table Just put together my new Teknion standing desk (the hiSpace Quick Connect Electric Height-Adjustable Table) delivered yesterday. I ordered this one because my Toronto den is way too small for a full 48"" Fully desks, but 42"" was too small. Teknion had a 46"" desk that I measured as fitting perfectly in my space. I'm very happy with this table!! Relatively quiet motor and smooth movement. Beautiful finish and I'm very happy with the range of height motion for short people like myself. I worried it'd be too wide as it is 29"" depth but it's the perfect comfortable size for me. I've been using it at the 22.5"" height since I'm 5'3"". Just a heads up I had a friend help me make it (it's got very heavy pieces). It took us about 3 hours because the written instruction manual is not as helpful. BUT it comes with a QR code to a more accurate video on installation. The only thing the video didn't contain was the accessory assembly and how to put on the snake cord cover for the main wire that operates the whole table. There were no grommets on the desk for wires or plugs. I'm not sure if the desk can be customized beyond the colour and size, but it doesn't bother me at all.I ordered it in provincial oak tabletop with white legs. They don't have very good pictures of the different wood effect surfaces, and I couldn't find reviews online, so I had to guess if it would work with my IKEA Kallax shelf in the walnut effect light gray. It's almost perfect! You can see the pictures of my shelf and the table right next to each other. I took the pictures with dimmer light and then with a brighter desk light.[WITH MAIN FLOOR LIGHT (NO BRIGHT DESK LIGHT): IKEA Kallax in Walnut Effect Light Gray (left) and Teknion hiSpace Quick Connect Electric Height-Adjustable Table in Provincial Oak (right)](  BRIGHT DESK LIGHT: IKEA Kallax in Walnut Effect Light Gray (left) and Teknion hiSpace Quick Connect Electric Height-Adjustable Table in Provincial Oak (right)]( am SO glad I went with provincial oak -- it couldn't have been a better match! I almost ordered coastal elm but that would have been way too light and more yellow/less neutral. It's so hard to tell though without proper pictures on their website to give you context for the different lighting.I'm really happy with the purchase, though it was an expensive one. This was worth it to me to find something I love to use every day. I'm no longer cramped in my workspace and still able to fit it in my relatively small den.Also I'm using a used Teknion grey Contessa Chair that I just got from a used furniture store in Mississauga. I had never heard of Teknion before a couple months ago and wasn't able to find any real reviews or information on their products online. But I'm really glad I took the chance on their stuff because they seem like good quality products. Also bonus that they're a Canadian company so I feel happy supporting them too! "

office,"Are you being as Direct as you can be at work? Directness is a valuable skill that everyone should have, but most people aren't direct because it can be uncomfortable.More commonly, people are passive aggressive. That, or they'll gossip, hoping word will reach someone instead of going to them directly with their complaint or criticism.Most of us don't like the idea of directness, even if we actually appreciate it. We don't like the feeling that we might be attacked. When we perceive a message as too direct, we're likely to become defensive.>Being direct with others is about sharing your feelings in a timely and appropriate wayBut when done well, being direct puts issues out in the open for everyone to consider. It's a faster and more productive way to communicate.The key to being direct at work is to communicate in clear, concise, and rational terms, assertively, but not angrily.## Why you need to be direct at workTo work for a company as a long-term career, you need to be able to speak directly about your position, ideas, and opinions.Especially in meetings with your team, being direct makes it easier for people to provide advice and feedback on the situation. Directness gives them an opportunity to help you because they know specifically where the issue is. It saves everyone time because you're saying what you really mean.Being [direct]( allows you to have a better relationship with your coworkers and your manager. When there are problems at work, you can clear them up, rather than letting them linger. And your meetings can be shorter.Feel free to comment down below on what you think about being direct in the workplace! "

office,"Can this get more toxic? (Seeking advice) Greetings, fellas!  Let me introduce myself and then take you into the traumatizing part.  THE STORY: I'm an MBA campus fresher (graduated in summer, 2021) working as a consultant in a well known IT company. Managed to convert my very first campus job interview and landed up here. Joined the company in the month of July and it was WFH till September. I was told by my manager that I should report to Client's office (in another city) and this was not even a week in advance. Then I had to ask him (ended up in a little spat) to give some reasonable amount of time. And somehow I won the argument and got finally moved to the new city. I started working from the client's place (as the same is mandated by our company) and everything went smooth for a month's time. My manager called me one Sunday morning and requested me to support another project (the other project he leads) for this Sunday alone as they are having a tough time meeting the deadlines. I accepted as that was the very first favor my manager ever asked me. But since then he calls me on every Friday evening to book my availability for the weekend to support that another project. I couldn't say NO and basically got into this trap. I have been working on like this for 2 months without any weekly offs. When I was already pretty pissed at this routine, he wanted to report to this other project's client location which is in the other end of the city. It took me 5 hours commutation (to and fro) when I did for one day. That day I lost my temper and had a very open discussion with my manager that I can't work in 2 projects and why don't you make the people in that another project responsible instead of pressurizing me. He was like ""This how the industry works...we gotta pitch in other projects as well in times of distress...The consultant here are not very well performing..."" And I said why don't you replace them or get people from free pool (a term used to refer to the people who are not assigned to any projects). He kept mum and didn't bother me much to work in that project anymore. But he promised me that he will give me compensatory leaves for the all the weekends that I have worked.Now for a week's time I'm peacefully working in my own project and they are expecting me to work literally 247 and on weekends too. I go to client's place at 9.30 and work there till 6. They still expect me to go back to my room and connect again (bloody VPN). I am starting to hate this project for mainly 3 reasons...  1) This is remotely related to the shit I studied in my MBA and literally a high school person can do this with a month's training what I got as a part of the induction program.  2) The working hours are erratic and I need some me time to prepare for CFA Level 1 (I'm passionate about finance and looking to build a career in investment banking) & other job interviews(yes, I'm actively looking to switch)  3) The longer I stay in this company, I more I am seen as an IT person which is a drawback if I wanna switch to core finance jobs) I have recently applied for 2 compensatory leaves (out of 10) and my manager is pissed that I'm availing them. I was like WTH. I am seeing this pattern where consultants in our domain (esp working under my manager) are resigning. I have come to know that 8 people have resigned in the last 2 months. When I spoke with them, I realized that all are frustrated with the manager, team culture (haphazard manner of assigning consultants randomly in projects other than their own projects, similar to me issue).  MY DECISION: I have decided to switch from this company and am actively looking for other opportunities. I should also prepare for CFA L1 simultaneously. But I'm totally willing to work in this project from 9 to 6.  ADVICE REQUIRED: I don't know how to say NO to the extra working hours. I can't talk to HR as they are also equally toxic. I don't wanna entertain office calls other than my working hours (i.e; 9 to 6). Don't wanna attend calls on weekends too. (Weekends are holidays as per company policy but manager wants us to work because of his inefficiency to manage people) Can't afford to quit now and search for jobs being unemployed. How do I handle this? "

Pam is objectively the most qualified for the job. When she stepped into the role of Office Administrator she essentially was the covert Office Manager. Not only would this have been amazing and realistic character growth going from Receptionist to Manager, but it would also give Pam a chance to go back more into her original comedic role. Which was her reactions to how people interact with her, how people treat her as a female boss and how she reacts to that, the idea that she may be perceived as ‚Äúwearing the pants‚Äù in her marriage, any conflicts of interest where she‚Äôs perceived as favouring Jim more, Dwight being really protective of her when people disrespect her etc. Whilst also giving us some more emotional development, how‚Äôs she going to deal with leading meetings and disciplining others.

office,"Coworkers Are Trying to Control Office and Interfering with Work Sorry in advanced if this is a bit all over the place. It's just building up worse and worse with no improvement and it's stressing us out.I've been dealing with a pretty frustrating coworker and their friend since week 2 of me starting this job. It all sparked over staples. We can call the main one Susan and the friend Helen. I have no idea what to do anymore.Background: I have poor vision so I missed a few staples I dropped and when Helen reminded me to pick up the staples I drop (as I tried to do, but I can't always see them all) I told her ""Okay. I usually try to."" Helen returned 30 seconds later and I repeated the same thing. No anger or frustration or malice about it. I knew she just didn't know about my vision issues. Queue the rest of the day when I'm not doing anything with staples but the other newbie is, and Susan started placing piles of staples that weren't from me onto my desk. When I confronted her and said I didn't appreciate that course of action, Susan yells at me saying I was rude to Helen (which Helen said several times afterwards I wasn't). Ever since then it's been snide comments, making fun of my appearance, throwing things from others clients into my trays (could be HIPAA risk if it isn't one I have access to), and even trying to touch my things, go through my trash/recycling, and open my cabinets. It didn't help matters when Susan was reported for stealing a package mailed to our office by mistake by an old employee, and tried to sell it on FB. She got to stay even though it posed a HUGE risk. They both also read patient information out loud for funsies which could cause us to be penalized for violating HIPAA.Present: The bullying hasn't stopped. Susan is overreaching by stealing people's food to throw away when she says it unhealthy then insult them for their weight, following me when I am trying to help coworkers get supplies just to tell the coworkers that I'm wrong (never actually talks to me, but will noticeably ignore me and only talk to the coworkers I'm helping), and is now guilting my trainees for using supplies and printers in our room and it's forcing my Trainee to go to other departments to do her print/scan jobs to avoid Susan. Helen is just pretty much a gossip accomplice but praises Susan and helps hide when she does something wrong. They are also both using a cleaner we've pretty much have been told to stop using because it's triggering my asthma and can put me out of work for a few days if I'm breathing in too high of a concentration, as well as causing migraines to several others. Our bosses literally ordered a different cleaner to replace it but they won't change it.I keep reporting these issues because it's been obvious much of it is unprofessional, unethical, and just uncalled for, but our leadership is just too busy to remember to fix it. Susan and Helen refuse to listen to anyone. They practically play boss when they are at the same level as everyone else, and anyone speaking up about it becomes their next target. Coworkers think HR won't do anything and I'm afraid they're right, as HR is works remote and doesn't witness this behavior.TL;DR: Coworkers are gossiping and bullying people and are now Interfering with mine and a trainee's work and leadership pretty much isn't doing anything.

office,"Boundaries For context, I‚Äôm the administrative assistant for my department that manages HOA‚Äôs. Aside from me, there are the Association Managers and my department head who does the bookkeeping. Managers should be self explanatory, plus they get paid more than me. Today, my department head tells me that our newest Manager hire needs more to do and asks me for my thoughts on having her do a small task that I usually do but can‚Äôt keep on top of as much because of more emergent things that come up on the daily. I told her if she (dept head) felt she (new Manager) is up for the task, I‚Äôm happy to have her take it off my plate. Dept head then says she‚Äôd like me to train her on doing this task. The task is this: mail items received each day are scanned and sent to me in a large batch via email; I then separate the pages out into individual files and save them in our clients folders where they should go as they should be named per our office protocol. I told her I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable training someone ‚Äúabove me, so to speak‚Äù. Her reaction was utter confusion I would ever say such a thing, and to tell me that everyone in our department is valued equally, and that since I‚ÄôM having such a rough time right now, it seems like time they (the office) ‚Äúcircle the wagons‚Äù for me (I‚Äôm going through a divorce). I‚Äôm not skipping any context, it literally went from ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to train someone in a higher pay grade than me‚Äù to ‚Äúwell clearly you‚Äôre just going through some stuff‚Äù??? I am both incredibly confused and annoyed that she would bring up my personal life, as I like to keep a lot of distance between my work life and my personal life. And I don‚Äôt know what it has to do with anything? Kicker - she said in the end she would have someone else train her. "

office,"Supply Storage Question I have problems with how the supplies are stored in my office.For context, I'm 5'4"". I'm average height for a woman. Alot of the supplies are on higher shelves than i can reach. Office kitchenet for example. The coffee (which i don't drink) is kept on a shelf i can just barely reach, and the tea and hot chocolate (which i do) is kept on the shelf above. I need to drag a chair over to reach it, which I find mortifying, so i find myself just not using it. Some of the printer paper i can't reach, so i can't print until someone else refills the machine.I know the guys don't do this on purpose. I know its not malicious. But it kind of hurts that no one thinks of this. There's one other coworker that's my height, and  she's developed the same habits.

office,"Who has a problem with keeping their desk from looking like a dump? If you're like me, staying organized can be a tough task. That's in all aspects whether its my desk, life, work, school etc. The last couple of years I have tried my best to keep my desk organized because I found that when I was organized at my desk and there wasn't much clutter around I could get a lot more stuff done!Here are some tips/benefits about keeping organized in your workplace:## Tips For Staying Organized At The ComputerIf you are at your computer, take a moment to [organize]( the items on your desk.Move any papers that need to be typed into piles organized by priority. Be sure to use separate folders for each type of document you have created so they can be easily found later. If you have printed things out, organize them in separate stacks of what is complete and what needs to be worked on.Move pens and paper clips into the holder or cup you keep at your desk as well as any post-it notes that need to be used.When you finish your work, make sure that everything is put away in its correct location on your desk.A cluttered computer desk will prevent you from working quickly or efficiently because you can't find things that are necessary for work.Stay organized at the computer to avoid wasting time searching for items.## Tips For Staying Organized While Working From HomeWhen you work from home, it is easy to get distracted and let things pile up.Avoid this by making a schedule for yourself so that you know when you will work each day and what tasks you need to focus on. Make sure your desk is clean before starting, and if possible, use a dedicated desk for work, rather than sitting at your kitchen table.Do not leave any dishes or laundry on your desk, because it will add even more messy items to your desk. If you finish your coffee, finish your snack, or take off your sweatshirt because it has warmed up, take a minute to stand up and put the item where it goes. Moving around a little will probably do you some good.## Benefits of Staying OrganizedOrganized people are less stressed and more productive. In the long run, staying organized is a great way to boost your self-confidence and self-esteem.Organized people have been shown to be better at making decisions because they can see things clearly without getting overwhelmed by clutter.Organized people also tend to be happier.If you guys have any tips for keeping your desk(and life) organized, feel free to drop them below!

When I started a junior member of staff was outright bitchy to me because she didn‚Äôt like the fact that I had came in at a position higher than her, despite me having several years of experience in this role and the professional qualifications to back this up. I discussed this to management at the time who has conversations with everyone to basically tell them that it wouldn‚Äôt be tolerated. Well it went from straight up bitchy comments to sly digs and undermining me wherever possible. And a few moreJoined in - like a clique formed and because I wasn‚Äôt in it, I was against it. After seeing how another colleagues dispute played out, I decided that reporting it again just wasn‚Äôt worth it. The outcome was basically deal with it as adults and if you don‚Äôt like it, find another job. Both involved have now left for other jobs. That brings me round to the string of promotions that were given out, to those that I had complained about. Something about their promotions seemed to have stroked their egos and the outright bitchyness came out of the woodworks. Whispers in the office. Being excluded fromStuff like meetings that I needed to be in. Then planning nights out with the majority of the office. So I have handed my notice in at workAlthough I am working my notice, management has stated that they thought that it has all calmed down and they were genuinely sorry to hear that I felt this way. So another event was planned yesterday where they planned to meet up In secret. Whispers while they planned it. So once I found out I was once again being excluded, I raised this with management who effectively gaslighted me and made me feel like this is my problem. Like I‚Äôm being the awkward one and that we should deal with it like adults. Now I might have taken this differently on another occasion, but since I had watched a very similar scenario play out between other colleagues, I can see clearly that it is a toxic work culture and I am almost convinced that  I am being gaalighted by management so that I don‚Äôt raise a formal complaint.

office,"Do You Practice Employees Performance Assessment at the Workplace Assessing employee performance is one of the crucial responsibilities of the managers, HR, and other authorized parties. Employee performance assessment at the workplace is necessary because it helps management assign bonuses, promote, or even demote employees. Also, it helps employers understand employees‚Äô contributions in the workplace or a team. But how to evaluate employee performance? Here are some ways to I have done:## Peer AssessmentThe way your peers see you at work tells a lot about your performance. An employee spends more time with his peers than the boss or manager, etc. That‚Äôs why peer assessment makes an important criterion in the performance assessment for all employees. The peers include group members and team members, etc. For this assessment, you can use questionnaires for the research.## Self-AssessmentIn self-assessment, employees fill up a questionnaire about themselves. They evaluate their performance and behavior at the workplace and their behavior with their colleague. Most people say that self-assessment is not too effective because employees normally get biased here. But you can use self-assessment along with the other performance measurement criteria to assess an employee‚Äôs progress at the workplace.## Work QualityDoes the employee only do the work to pass his time? What is the quality of his work? Do you often find out mistakes in it? A positive answer to these questions means that the employee is working dedicatedly, which positively impacts their performance. Besides, you can also measure work quality through client feedbacks and their satisfaction level, etc.## 360-Degree Feedback360-degree feedback incorporates different assessment criteria such as peer assessment, self-assessment, and superior‚Äôs assessment. This method is considered ideal because it covers all aspects. 360-degree feedback is more reliable. However, it may be a little time-consuming.## Creativity Level[Assess employee competencies]( through their creativity level. For the right performance assessment at the workplace, employees‚Äô creativity must be incorporated. For instance, what potential solution did the employee consider? How did he assess the risk, and what actions did he take to overcome them? An employee with a higher creativity level can work more efficiently and provide better work results.## Improvement ConsistencyIs the employee consistent with his progress? It should not be like he gave excellent results in one project, while his contribution is near to zero in the other project. For making performance assessment better, considering consistency in an employee‚Äôs progress is vital. While deciding on an appraisal or bonus, the employee with higher progress consistency should be preferred.Along with these criteria for performance assessment at the workplace, you can also consider their contribution in sales revenue, ability to take ownership, timeliness, staying on the decided budget, and much more. So, whether your employees work remotely or inside the office premises, these performance assessment methods will help you analyze your business growth and employee performance. "

If you find that this could all be in your head, talk to them and let them know about the things that make you uncomfortable.Or, if you find the creepy coworker sitting right beside you, then getting some privacy might help you. Even if you cannot separate the work desks, get a privacy panel to partition you and them.### Address the IssueIf none of the above tactics work and you find the coworker relatively creepy after this, then make sure you address the issue with the management. They will either make you shift to another team or maybe even inspect the coworker for their unprofessional behavior by speaking up.That's how to handle in my workplace. How about you? What will you act if you have to work with a creepy colleague. "

After this, I talked to her about it and said we were talking about technical things about the plan and then basically without realizing it, made her feel like I insinuated it would go over her head.I respect her probably more than anyone I have ever worked with and think she is so smart and could totally understand, but I was so off today for some stupid reason. she slacked me to tell me this but didn't seem super mad, and I apologized and tried to explain. My slack reaction was of absolute horror that I accidentally said something like that.I am so not the type of person to intentionally hurt others and I like everyone and am not like this, she and everyone knows this, but I can't get over what will happen tomorrow and if she is okay, so I am kicking myself because I haven't heard back because it is after hours.

Due to COVID a majority of our organization was sent to work from home. A few months in, a few staff were allowed to return to the office. My sub-department did not return till April 2021. I share my office with one of my coworkers because we are also technically a separate department and our office has a large copy/printing machine. My coworker did not return to work due to having to be out for leave.Upon my return, I learned some coworkers where using our printer when other printers were down or backed up. I didn‚Äôt mind at all. However this continued even when I returned and one person would continue to use the printer when I was in the office, on a phone call, meeting etc. What really disturbed me is this person would just walk into my office, wouldn‚Äôt knock or wouldn‚Äôt ask if it was an appropriate time to use the printer. I complained to my supervisors but nothing came of it. A couple weeks ago, my coworker returned and for personal reasons, needs privacy at certain times of day. The way our office is set up, I can‚Äôt see her due to filing cabinets so she‚Äôs able to have her privacy even when I‚Äôm in the office. For these times, we put 2 ‚Äúdo not disturb signs‚Äù on our door and we lock the door from the outside.

My coworker is sending her own complaint to our supervisors but I am wondering if there is some device or if there is a hack we can use on the door so this no longer happens??

office,"Massive workload and duties differences for same role?? I'm struggling, help!! Hey guys!I (23F, ireland) recently got a job in an office. It seems to be largely male dominated but the office manager is a woman. A man (let's call him Joe) and myself were both hired at the same time for the same position. However, his workload is much smaller than mine. I monitor all customer support inboxes, calls, live chat, as well as processing returns, releasing new orders, and testing stock. I often get snowed under work and the manager always has a passive aggressive response to my questions or acts annoyed/stressed when I talk to her. When I've made mistakes she's also reacted badly. Meanwhile, Joe only tests stock and sometimes covers reception. One day he was meant to take calls also but he set his phone to forward them all to my desk. Nothing was done. At the same time I couldn't physically answer all calls etc and get my queue done. 3 weeks after I started, another new guy was hired (let's call him Dave). Today I witnessed Dave being trained to release orders which I would normally do. The manager was very kind to him and gave him no deadline to finish just to ""get comfortable with the system"". When I started I was just told to do it and get it done asap. Dave has also been only given one other duty besides ""getting comfortable"". TLDR: my male peers' workload is much smaller and they have much less pressure applied to them than I do. When they make mistakes it's brushed off. I'm constantly stressed and rushed and pressured to get a 3-4x larger workload done and my mistakes are treated worse than theirs.I'm dreading going into work these days because I know how stressed and anxious I'll be all day, especially with passive aggressive treatment from the manager. How do I approach this? "

I know that qualifications arent everything, but I am massively more qualified with industry specific qualifications and much more experience than all of them)Management are aware of the issue, but it‚Äôs so busy that it‚Äôs not getting dealt with or picked up on when management are around.

office,Outdoor Office  
office,"The decline of telework In the midst of telework last year, our agency head implied we would be able to keep teleworking indefinitely after the pandemic. Suddenly a couple months ago we were told that full time telework would not be allowed at all (even with typical medical exemptions like ""high risk"") and we had to be in the office at least 2 days a week (any 2 days). When questioned on it the agency head claimed he never said we'd do this forever. This week an email was sent out by our department manager that we would soon be moving to being in the office 3 days a week. This leaves only two days to telework, fewer for those doing 9 or 10 hour schedules.Also this week at least one employee had his telework agreement revoked just to meet a deadline. Ironically he had to take sick leave instead of working from home when he got sick and didn't want to risk spreading anything to coworkers, and consequently the deadline was not met.Unfortunately all these events make it seem like management has soured on teleworking, period. This is a public agency, so tends to be a little more backwards. But nothing we do really requires being in the office, other than obscure ""face-to-face meetings."" Collaboration has worked quite well on Microsoft Teams. How do we as lower level employees encourage management to change direction? I can't see making this a union issue, as not all union jobs are equal, some more customer facing ones may need people in the office. But before 2020 we always supposedly had telework options but it was never approved for most people. The latest guidelines reduced the number of days required in office, but it looks like we are trending back towards telework not being approved. Today it's 2 days, in the near future 3 days, soon after that it would be easy to push for 4 or 5 days in the office and we're back to being tied down. Leaving is certainly an option... But that also has tradeoffs like working in the private sector and the added stress that comes with it. "

office,"Summer in the office So... Working over the summer in an office is an experience and a half and I'd say so far, July has offered a ton of firsts for me as a fairly new office-worker. Our office is located in an ""Office Hotel"" where several businesses rent office space. I thought I'd share some summer-stories from our little corner of the office world.Our 6-man admin office is H.O.T. in the humid summer and we're all slowly melting as we type away on our keyboards, making sure the business is kept running even as clients, business partners ect. are all on vacation, though somehow they still manage to send us invoices.I had to disturb my supervisor on the first day of her summer vacation, because the big boss wanted to know if we had billed a customer some money for a consultant and what months we hadn't charged for this past year and I had no clue where to check that.Last week the coffee-maker on our floor broke down and was out of comission for 4 days. As an office worker, I am of course addicted to caffeine, otherwise the numbers just don't come out right and the keys on my keyboard start magically moving, like they're playing musical chairs - Keyboard edition.Right after lunch today I managed to break the industrial printer, and since I'm the new kid with a ton of typing-work to do in a database, we're setting up, I'm stuck at the very very VERY hot office, hoping a technician will call and say he can fix it today (so I can actually do meaningful work tomorrow).

office,"Syncing ""back to office"" moments I work in a small (10ish) IT consulting company. Even before covid started we worked part-time in office/at home. Since Covid restriction are now being lifted in our area, some people are going back to the office (although less regularly). However with such a small workforce and 2 offices it is uncertain  who will be in the office when. I think it could be very advantageous to know which colleagues will be in the office when: 1) Since our office is not big enough to seat everybody we would know when it would be too crowded2) You know when to go to the office to catch up with a certain colleague (Or to avoid them ;-) ) So I was looking for a solution that is easy to use, low-effort. There should be almost no boundaries to enter a location status (preferable a (few) day in advanced). In the past we looked at creating calendar event and sharing this to everybody else, but it didn't seem to catch on (I assume it was to convoluted to look at everybody's agenda all he time, to much effort to add every day in there...).

office,"We're completely out of our depth with project management options. Any advice on getting started? I work for a very small office public facing office has a large client base. We have a busy season that requires us to collaborate & process work quickly.We find that we've suddenly outpaced our current processes and need to catch up to the modern era.  It seems like everything I find QUICKLY outpaces my understanding, though. I'm in a loop where I don't understand what terms to search for, and I find things like ""eliminate silos with 360 viewing,"" which just sounds like buzzwords to me.  Last year, we made our first step and got a drop box through Citrix. Getting that going wasn't too painful, and I guess it made me over confident. I'm completely out of my depth now trying to investigate 2 options, Workspace & Wrike. I'm looking at these because they're with Citrix, and I felt it would be easier to adapt if we stick with programs that have a similar feel, but I'm not sold on them if anyone has suggestions! I'm coming to reddit because I've talked to my sales rep 3 times now but I'm no further along. During the call about Workspace I got completely lost in the jargon and can't even understand the questions they're asking me.  (They're sending a list of requirements that I can share with the outside IT rep we use, but it doesn't make sense to ask him to decide for me if this does what I want.)Does anyone use Workspace and/or Wrike? Do you like it? Do you use anything else you would recommend instead? If anyone is so patient, here's a summary of what I'm mainly trying to achieve. -We need to be able to share calendars-We'd like to do better on time tracking-We need better tools to be able to pass files between employees & management while adding notes/corrections/approvals without bogging down our email.  (Right now, we save docs to a server and only one person can be editing a file at a time. It's madness)-We lack a good client management system. I need something that functions as a database where I can search clients by name, view contact info, and quickly scan recent notes (IE, a client calls and says the owner told them XYZ, I want to check for his notes.) -We use a random assortment of tools like TeamViewer & they require us to set up individual workstations with dual monitors in our physical office just so that 100% remote employees can connect from home and have their dual monitors work properly. We don't mind having individual pc's in office if that's what we need to do, but 2 monitors on each-?! My vague understanding of Workspace is that it will work with our server to allow people to remote connect to a virtual machine from anywhere and that it would completely replace TeamViewer or a need for a VPN option.

(Current software is a free app not made for a medical office, so name and appt time is all I can use.)I would like something that can schedule clients on a one-time or recurring basis, with places for the copay/deductible/other owed amounts, and a spot to list their current insurance company so I don't have to look it up each time to verify eligibility. I'd like all of this on a ""click and view"" option directly from the calendar, instead of having to go all the way into a client profile to see it. Anything that is relatively similar will be looked into. Cost is another factor... I'm finding these things are rather pricey on a monthly basis. Since I'm not doing billing services (honestly just scheduling, I create my own invoices as needed) we don't need to pay for alltheservices. Any ideas? Websites to check out? Thanks in advance! "

office,"Managing Meetings While Returning to the Office First Call: A Retrospective on MeetingsUnder most circumstances, you should never have a meeting about a meeting. Such a blunder usually indicates you‚Äôre not prepared.This time it‚Äôs different.An excellent first step for any recurring meeting you have is to add a quick retrospective to the agenda.The first item should be a discussion of how the meeting itself has evolved during the WFH period and how it could be modified, shortened, or even eliminated now that you‚Äôre back in the office.¬†It makes sense to take 15 minutes on this for every regular meeting on your calendar. After all, if you shorten the meeting time, eliminate the meeting, or reduce its frequency, you‚Äôll easily make that time back.¬†Shorter and Fewer MeetingsTime spent in meetings is time away from producing work, so it‚Äôs worth reducing the amount of time spent in in-person meetings, conference calls, and virtual meetings if it‚Äôs not productive.¬†The two trajectories are reducing the number of meetings on your calendar and reducing the length of the meetings.¬†Some simple hints for reducing meeting invites and [meeting]( length include: Require all meetings to have an agenda and a purpose. Make it a company policy that any meetings without an agenda are automatically canceled. Do follow-ups on the tasks and action items before the next meeting so that the team doesn‚Äôt have to rehash what happened in the previous meetings. Use asynchronous communication for status and routine updates. Create short templates and questionnaires for people to fill out prior to the meeting. Use simple and pointed questions such as ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs one thing you‚Äôre stuck on this week?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs one area where you want feedback from the team?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs one big win you had this week?‚ÄùAsnyc: Keep It GoingWorking from home made all of us experts in asynchronous communications. E-mail, chat, voice, and asynchronous video platforms aren‚Äôt going anywhere. Maintain working practices that have helped your company function well during the period of remote work.¬†If an asynchronous method is working well, keep it in place. There may be a desire or temptation to move to in-person meetings but resist. Meetings are expensive. "
office,"Do I need permission to install systems to my building? Hi fellas Currently I'm thinking to add some more tech things to my office building.

However feeling that people know when you're going to the restroom and how long you're there is pretty weird. Is this legal? To place cameras outside of the restroom?

Each person is responsible for their own assigned accounts. There are basic operating standards, however there is a very wide array of duties/requirements depending on the client needs/industry. Because we work so independently, the moral and camaraderie is terrible. It has lead to gossip, tattle-tale, and just a ‚Äúdog eat dog‚Äù environment. I want to change this culture to be more team oriented and just a better place for us to all work. Even though we work independently, we are a team with goals.

Hi y‚Äôall,I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts about door etiquette online - open vs closed - but haven‚Äôt seen much in the way about half open doors or if that means or suggests anything. Recently started back at the office and my quarantine habit has me eating lunch around 11. Since it‚Äôs a little early, I keep my door halfway open or mostly closed. My thought is this: if people want to drop by, they can, but the gesture suggests I want privacy without being a jerk. I was hoping this filters out unwanted chit-chats during my lunch and keep all talk business related (if it‚Äôs deemed important enough to disturb). Is this common or bad etiquette? Is there a better way to do this? Thanks in advance! "

Jim, the branch's top salesman, has been accused of embezzlement by a former employee. The rest of the office is in shock as they struggle to come to terms with the news.As the investigation progresses, it becomes clear that Jim is innocent and that the accusations are nothing more than a smear campaign by a rival company, who wanted to take down Dunder Mifflin. Jim rallies the office together to clear his name and prove his innocence.Meanwhile, Pam is struggling with her own personal crisis. She has been offered her dream job in New York, but it would mean leaving her husband, Jim, behind in Scranton. She must decide between her career and her marriage.In the end, Jim is cleared of all charges and the rival company is exposed for their deceit. Pam decides to stay in Scranton with Jim and the rest of the office. The Scranton branch emerges stronger than ever, united in the face of adversity.Throughout the story, the audience will see the characters of the office trying to navigate a difficult situation, showing their intelligence, creativity, and teamwork to overcome the scandal, proving that Dunder Mifflin Scranton is not just a place where people work, but a family.It's important to note that this is a fictional story and it's not related to any episodes from the original TV show. And again, as a language model, I don't have personal opinions or emotions, so I can't tell you whether the story is good or bad. "

The second one would be sales.

But I don't feel that way at all, all scenes with her in it were kinda unsettling to me, and I think  I can now explain why:Karen pretended to be someone she isn't to be liked by Jim. The most obvious example for this is when Jan got fake boobs and Pam was joking about that with Jim. When Karen noticed, she immediately copied Pams behavior and pretended as if she also now noticed Jans enhancement. She didn't do this because she actually found it funny, she did it to get attention from Jim and make herself more likeable for him. She pretended to be someone she wasn't just for the sake of their relationship.That's the problem. And that's also the difference between her and Pam. Pam does not have to behave differently in front of Jim to make him like her. "

DunderMifflin,"Pam, If I‚Äôm 30 Years..  "
DunderMifflin,"I think I found Pam's casino night dress! (not exactly, of course) [This post keeps getting removed so just search ""Vintage 1990s Y2K Iridescent Purple and Blue Spaghetti Strap"" by ""GoogiesCloset""]( "
DunderMifflin,"Sorry I didn't have time to take a picture, can anyone tell me what bird this is?  "
DunderMifflin,Jenna‚Äôs post on FB. There will be a special episode for Steve Carell  
DunderMifflin,"A song in season 5 episode 25 (Cafe Disco) Well technically it‚Äôs in the superfan episodes, but at the very end Angela‚Äôs dancing to an alt rock song cleaning up the room. The only audible lyrics are something along the lines of ‚Äúi'm bringing it home i said kiss me miss me‚ÄùI literally can‚Äôt find it anywhere and it‚Äôs likely they produced it just for the show but I was hoping anyone else was able to find it. "
DunderMifflin,"What is the episode that you always skip during re-runs? For me, it is S6e14 The Banker where the investment banker comes to check in on the office. He speaks to Toby about liabilities in the office and the whole episode is just flashbacks of bits from previous episodes put together. I don't find it funny to look at all the bits back to back and they're not as funny as the original episodes because they lack the context. The whole episode just feels like a drag and I always skip it. I'll bore myself more than Toby bores Michael. "
DunderMifflin,"I feel like this scene never gets the cringe recognition it deserves. How did the writers let this happen, had they just given up at this point?  "
DunderMifflin,I don't think anyone benefits from wearing glasses as much as B.J Novak  
DunderMifflin,Went to get my daughter a build a bear and saw they are doing the office bears.  
DunderMifflin,You thought that ‚ÄúSpinnin‚Äô and Reelin‚Äô‚Äù was good before? [Creed even talks about the version in ‚ÄúThe Office‚Äù]( before he delves into what The Grass Roots kind of wrecked (as he actually left the band partly because they did not want to play their own instruments in the studio). 
DunderMifflin,How come in the later seasons the theme plays for shorter and longer on different episodes? I‚Äôve only just picked up on this but I‚Äôve noticed this inconsistency and I can‚Äôt think of an explanation. 
DunderMifflin,Keleventh time watching and opinions have changed The 3rd iteration of Ryan - when he's in his little office that Jim made - is funnier than I remember. Daryl is an arsehole and I enjoy watching him fall on his face time and time again. Gabe is friggin hilarious. 
DunderMifflin,From Second Life to Project Zomboid. Survivor Schrute  
DunderMifflin,What Office moment gives you the most secondhand embarrassment??? I'm rewatching season five and I can barely get through the parts when Jim is pretending to like soccer to impress Charles Miner. I'M DYING üò¨üíÄüòÖ 
DunderMifflin,"So, my wife has never watched The Office before, and we are binging it... We just started S4E1, and Angela was telling how Dwight should give her cat's medicine. And my wife, under her chuckles, said.. ""Why wouldn't she just kill it?!""  I am so happy right now üôÉ "
DunderMifflin,"Before today I never realized that Nellie kept the "" BER"" from Andy's nameplate.  "
DunderMifflin,Friend accidentally hit my knee while playing soccer. This is a threat.  
DunderMifflin,He immediately without skipping a beat jumped to hug her and it took her ages to think things through. She is the worst.  
DunderMifflin,"What are the rules of ""Who'd Ya Do""? Does it have any? There's one thing that's always bothered me about the fire episode -- it's not the way that Stanley is completely out of character eagerly jumping in to moderate middle school slumber party games instead of going home, it's that Who'd Ya Do isn't a game; it's just Jim saying ""hey everyone, let's all say which coworkers we're sexually attracted to"" and then getting awkward and flustered when it turns out he's part of everyone. How else was it supposed to go? Was it supposed to be like a Would You Rather type game but it just immediately went off the rails? "
DunderMifflin,I wonder if Ryan would try to sue Apple for their ecosystem being similar to WUPHF.  
DunderMifflin,"What is your hardest trivia question about the office? I want to hear your hardest to know facts about the office, I‚Äôm trying to stump my buddy and I feel like these aren‚Äôt difficult enough:What is Dwight‚Äôs favorite movie?- The crow What‚Äôs the only episode that didn‚Äôt require any rewrites?- Dinner PartyWhat‚Äôs Creed‚Äôs New Years Resolution in 2011?- To land a cartwheel How does Stanley like his iced Tea?- With three sugars and five creams You get the concept "
DunderMifflin,- Phyllis: Um. I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions and he was holding a map and when I walked over he had it out on the map. - Angela: Phyllis. You‚Äôre a married woman. What‚Äôs your favorite random joke? 
DunderMifflin,"If The Office was an anime, its op would be exactly like this  "
DunderMifflin,I‚Äôm watching the Pretzel Day episode. Does the intercom for announcements ever get used again in any other episode?

DunderMifflin,New tattoo in memory of the bird that flew into the office window üòî he will not be forgotten  
DunderMifflin,Saw this while driving around today. Thought I‚Äôd share  
DunderMifflin,"First Watch and I'm worried about Andy I'm watching the Office for the first time and I love Andy's character. I read that many fans say that he turns ""evil"" in the last two seasons, but I'm finishing the eight season and he's still a disastrous yet  sweet well meaning weirdo. Do I have to brace for the ninth season or did I read something misleading?How Is Andy generale viewed in the community?Thanks! "
DunderMifflin,Rainn Wilson spotted in look alike cam  
DunderMifflin,I contacted Peacock customer service and they revealed that season 6 of the Superfan Episodes will be here on February 1st. Mark your calendars!  
DunderMifflin,Worst characters imo . They wouldn't let Dwight to sit with his friends and they got mad when Dwight is trying to have a conversation with his group  
DunderMifflin,Who was the real scranton strangler?  
DunderMifflin,Just watch it again  
DunderMifflin,To make toys that look like tv characters  
DunderMifflin,"What‚Äôs this drinking game called, and what are the rules? Thanks  "
DunderMifflin,Can we talk about the entertainment selections in Dwight‚Äôs Caffeine Corner?  
DunderMifflin,favorite thats what she said scene  
DunderMifflin,throwback to when I labeled Mike's walkie-talkie... he didn't get it.  
DunderMifflin,does anybody know the holdup on the next seasons of the super fan episodes on peacock? they dropped pretty consistently for a while but now idk  
DunderMifflin,"I'm halfway through season 2. I hate Michael. Does he get any better? Hey first of all, this is obviously just my opinion, and if you like him, that's totally fine.I just finished the season 2 Christmas episode. S2E10.I just don't have fun watching any scene with Michael in it. He's such an unfunny cringy asshole. I don't know if it's just my past experience with terrible bosses but I absolutely despise him. I don't think I've laughed at anything he did so far.Does he grow up or nah? Does his joking style change? 95% of his jokes are at the expense of someone, the other 5% are at his own which I also don't enjoy much.I like everyone else, especially Andy and Toby, but sadly most of the show is centered on Michael.Just wondering if I should keep going. Other shows I enjoyed: B99, Good Place, Community, Arrested Development.Thanks. "
DunderMifflin,"It's annoying that they couldn't film an episode in Scranton but NBC sent the Parks and Rec cast to different states and countries. Rewatching Parks and Rec for the umpteenth time and it's nuts where the cast was sent even for some one off joke. Off the top of my head there are episodes with them in London, Scotland, Paris, Chicago, Indianapolis, The Grand Canyon, Washington DC, and San Francisco. The Office had Steve Carell in NYC (who was probably there for something else) and John and Jenna went to Niagara Falls....and that's it. And NBC wanted to fake that but they fought for it and agreed to send a very small crew. 9 years worth of episodes and not a single one was filmed in Scranton but Parks and Rec did 2 episodes at Lucas Stadium. I wonder if the cast of the Office were ever annoyed that they were in front of a green screen pretending to be in Florida or filming in downtown LA standing in for NYC then find out a Parks cast member is walking around the actual location like London or Paris. "
DunderMifflin,"Out of curiosity, what was it about pam? It might just be me but I'm not sure why all the men in the show like her? I find her personality quite boring, and I just am not sure of the appeal towards her?I get very confused why she rejected Jim twice, then when he gave up and dated someone else, she was unhappy that Jim wasn't chasing her? I just think it was unfair to karen to have someone, who had their chance and didnt take it, still professing their feelings to her boyfriend? "
DunderMifflin,Someone's a fan  
DunderMifflin,The Office is great at only swearing once and a while for maximum effect. My personal favorite example:  
DunderMifflin,"Dundee award ideas My son is turning 12 in February and I wanna get him a Dundie as part of his gift, but I'm terrible at coming up with funny yet age-appropriate ideas for what it should say. Thought this would be the perfect place to ask. "

DunderMifflin,Dwight's greatest invention: The toilet paper de-plyer  
DunderMifflin,"What if Kelly had actually been pregnant when she told Ryan she was? Well I hope you're still committed, because I'm pregnant.Shakes head "
DunderMifflin,"I'm sad we didn't get to see a Dundies when Michael and Jim were co-managers, meaning they would be co-hosts, but if we did how do you think it would go down? I mean, hosting the Dundies is one of the perks of being manager, so it's not like Jim would pass it up. "
DunderMifflin,"Threat level midnight After listening to the most recent ‚ÄúThe Office Ladies‚Äù podcast they were talking about Catherine Zeta Jones being Michael Scarn‚Äôs love interest. They were exploring people who couldn‚Äôt make the final cut I.e. Amy Adams, Idris Elba. I think it would have been funny to have the chair model as Michael‚Äôs fallen love interest instead of Catherine. Does anyone have thoughts on this? "
DunderMifflin,And he asks it so seriously.  
DunderMifflin,"my office tierlist [I'm sorry about Micheal, its just how I feel about him.]( "
DunderMifflin,"The deleted scenes on Peacock are not funny‚Ä¶ anyone agree? Rewatching the show for the billionth time but this time on the Peacock app. At first the little extra scenes were really exciting and it felt like watching it all new again, but as I‚Äôm getting deeper into the show the majority of them I can see why they were cut. Most of them aren‚Äôt super funny or even kind of awkward. I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs just because I‚Äôm not used to them so they feel out of place or not. It‚Äôs still really cool seeing the full scenes but I think the show is much better without them. Does anyone agree? "
DunderMifflin,"Who does Michael trust the most workwise? I'd say Oscar! Michael almost always kept him by his side. Be it for seminar, or interns search or trip to Canada or that press conference (limousine episode). I feel like he trusts him for his work even more than Jim or Dwight.What's your opinion? "
DunderMifflin,Does it bother anyone else that Jim will hang up the phone on a client when he's distracted by something Dwight is doing? Love the show and I know I shouldn't take it too seriously but it shits me every time he does it... 
DunderMifflin,Andy and the gang singing I try is one of my favorite scenes I wish it was longer.Any other music scenes y'all like? 
DunderMifflin,"Never watch seasons 8 & 9? Does anyone else pretend seasons 8 & 9 don‚Äôt exist? No Michael, Andy becomes a completely different person, Nellie, those interns or whatever they are‚Ä¶ Anytime I see a scene from one of those episodes it seems so alien and weird, and I‚Äôm bummed I am almost finished with the Office Ladies podcast because they are almost done with season 7. So rare that a show great show is great to the end. "
DunderMifflin,how can i skip the intro on peacock I didnt know where to post this but how can i skip the intro? 
DunderMifflin,"Pam vs Ryan I never realized how entertaining the rivalry between Pam and Ryan was until recently. Probably some of my favorite instances include Smoky Robinson, the breadsticks are like crack, and Ryan saying a homeless person should be the new manager. "
DunderMifflin,little ironic moment - later she actually doesnt want ‚ÄúPhilly Jim‚Äù (s4e9)  
DunderMifflin,Has to be my #1 favourite Dwight line. I‚Äôve even used it before lol  
DunderMifflin,"‚ÄúI could‚Äôve been growing mushrooms that were THIS high by now!‚Ä¶They‚Äôre mushrooms, they don‚Äôt get that high.‚Äù What‚Äôs your favorite random Dwight quote?  "
DunderMifflin,The Office speed radar intro - with drums!  
DunderMifflin,"After watching like a hundred times, I only now noticed how the whole thing started with Jan being mean to Pam in dinner party Right Jim and Pam enter their house, Pam and Michael hold their hug a little too long, and Jan noticed in the back last second. I never caught this amazing detail before somehow. Amazing acting. "
DunderMifflin,One of my favorite heartwarming scenes in the show - S5E18 Blood Drive  
DunderMifflin,"The Jim Halpert multiverse So everyone debates the Karen or Pam timelines but what about these:1. Jim stays with Katy and when Katy asks one they booze cruise ""do you think that will ever be us?"" Jim says yes.2. Jim and Jan: Casino night Jim and Jan are talking. Jan is spurned by Michael. Jim tells Jan she looks good and Jan takes it as an advance from Jim. They end up going home together after Pam rejects him.3. Jim and Brenda: Brenda from corporate returns Jim's message. They got out and Jim gets Jan's job at corporate. Brenda and Jim become a corp couple.Post marriage dark multiverses4. Jim and Kathy5. Jim and the women from them panel who says he would get a pass for anythingAre there any other possibilities that In not thinking of? "
DunderMifflin,"Michael Scott- the Boss Real question. Would Michael Scott IRL actually be a good person to work for? Or would he drive you crazy? I think on the show they overplay how annoyed people are by his antics at times to make the show funny, and he would actually be a pretty fun boss to work for. "
DunderMifflin,WHY AM I JUST LEARNING ABOUT THIS? I must be late but why is this not talked about everywhere? So many new scenes with stories they missed and connections they didn‚Äôt go through that add a lot more context. Amazing.  
DunderMifflin,Favourite Creed moments: he has forged money on hand and is not afraid to use it.  
DunderMifflin,Is it lanch party or lunch party?  
DunderMifflin,Why waste time say lot word when few word do trick? Does Kevin have an IQ of 30?  
DunderMifflin,What is your favourite Dwight moment?  
DunderMifflin,Season 6 Superfan episodes release date? Does anyone know when it will be released? 
DunderMifflin,"Canadian Netflix seems to be adding extra parts to episodes? At the end of the last episode of Season 7 (Ep 26 ""Search Committee: Part 2"") there is about 30 seconds at the end that I have never seen before, where a Oscar, Pam and Phyllis have talking heads where they talk about who they think should be manager. I have seen this series at least 15 times throughout, and I guarantee I have never seen this before. Can anybody else confirm this? I feel like I am going crazy.  Edit: I feel as though I have seen extra parts in other episodes as well, but I figured I just completely forgot somehow "
DunderMifflin,Earth-You don‚Äôt have to be crazy to live here but it helps.  
DunderMifflin,"Evaluating the characters too much? Hi folks!I suppose I might get a lot of downvotes for this post but it's been too longWhy people here are evaluating the show characters and their deeds so much? Like, Jim/Pam/else is good/bad for this and that, etcetera. First, nobody is absolutely good or bad (and the categories are subjective) -- both in the show and irl. Second, it's a show, the characters cannot possibly be as consistent as people irl!! A lot of plot lines are built around Jim/Pam/Phyllis/others doing shit. I'm not sure it makes sense to expect very consistent behavior of characters in light of this. Finally, again, it's a show, relax, don't take things so seriously! No need to be morality police all the time. "
DunderMifflin,"Jim's teapot note to Pam, v.3  "
DunderMifflin,"Why doesn‚Äôt Micheal like Andy in the beginning? Sorry if this has been asked before but I‚Äôm rewatching and I‚Äôm on S3 E13 the return, and Andy is trying REALLY hard with Micheal. Micheal says Andy‚Äôs annoying him, declines to hang out after work and just generally rejects his efforts. Micheal spends his life desperate to be liked by the employees so thought he‚Äôd be lapping it up from Andy? "
DunderMifflin,Why was Dwight‚Äôs sick blue when he found out the DNA test results for Angela‚Äôs baby?  
DunderMifflin,"The scene where Robert strips down naked and start swimming in his pool. I think this is a scene that people talk too little about. The first look of Kevin, Robert jumping into the pool and the others desperately trying to get out of the pool. Ryan and Gabe being kissasses and also skinny-dipping, which Gabe does in the greatest way possible and in a way that just describes his character. Then lastlly, Jim driving as fast as he can and destroying a mailbox.I just wanted to share the golden moments of that scene. "
DunderMifflin,"need help- episode ID There's an episode of the office where Michael Scott calls everyone into the conference room and ask them to just shout out ideas, everyone is confused because they have no idea what he is talking about, I want to say eventually Andy shouts out a few buzz words that Michael gets excited about, and then others get it and start shouting out random buzzwords as well until it's just random confusing excitement. What episode is this? "
DunderMifflin,"As a Christian, first thing that came to mind when I read this bit of the Bible after watching the whole show  "
DunderMifflin,"You cannot make this shit up, this is hilarious. Why the hell would the writers intend that???  "
DunderMifflin,"The office trivia tonight. Pick our team name! My top choice so far ""You've been meatballed!"" "
DunderMifflin,"I have binged The Office in 3 - 4 months, this is the result of the last 2 episodes, you could say I got kinda attached to the characters.  "
DunderMifflin,need help- episode ID  
DunderMifflin,"This has likely been caught by everyone but me, but just in case: on my umpteenth rewatch, I realized the ""cherub"" figurine that Dwight claims he returned to Angela earlier in the ""Money"" episode (S4E7) is what he is grasping when Jim comes in to console him in the middle of the night.  "
DunderMifflin,It seems like you already know where :)  
DunderMifflin,What do you guys think Toby‚Äôs roasts would‚Äôve been if Michael let him in the roast?  
DunderMifflin,Angela?  
DunderMifflin,"Dwight the enigma: how competent is he really? He capably puts wrestling holds on Nick and Gabe, yet he gets humiliated by Michael. Later becomes a ‚Äúblack belt‚Äù out of pity.He is the best salesmen in the company, yet he is entirely useless when selling to women and often verbally abused clients when getting bad news.He paintballs all the time and offers lessons, yet when fighting Michael they both just kinda run in circles.He claims to be efficient and effective (and his numbers show it when he was acting manager under Jo) but he also implements time wasting rules for the sake of authoritarianism (like a 30 digit copier code).He capably runs a beer farm w/tractors and yet he crashes the forklift immediately and wastes a whole day failing to load a truck.I guess my verdict is that he is intellectually and physically pretty capable but his own personality gets in the way of a lot of aspects of his life. "
DunderMifflin,When Jim's friends ask where he works  
DunderMifflin,Kevin making a joke on Ed Truck in this deleted sceneüíÄ  
DunderMifflin,2 things.. So Pudge outsells Andy? and Jim outsells Dwight? I‚Äôm surprised Dwight wasn‚Äôt mad about this.  
DunderMifflin,Something about Stanley's expressions has always reminded me of Snuffleupagus from Sesame Street. Anyone else?  
DunderMifflin,Easily one of my most favorite scenes  
DunderMifflin,Name the rest of the songs on this album...  
DunderMifflin,What is your favorite post-Michael episode other than the finale? For me it‚Äôs definitely work bus. 
DunderMifflin,"Why are people defending Pam in this scene? ""Maybe you should've been there"" is the bitchiest line ever. Saying that to a man that's under extreme stress just like that. And at the end making it look like Jim is the one who's selfish. And people still defend her? Just wow!  "
DunderMifflin,Did anybody watch the show from start to finish as it aired on Television? What was it like? 
DunderMifflin,Real life Michael Scott sign in the wild - WUPHF!  
DunderMifflin,Spotted in Amsterdam!  
DunderMifflin,OUR PRICES HAVE NEVER BEEN LOWER!!!  
DunderMifflin,"Help Me Find an Episode? Which episode is the one where Michael goes to corporate to give a financials presentation to David Wallace, but instead he makes a video about the staff? Its fairly early because he just slept with Jan. "

DunderMifflin,"Worst moments on The Office for you? Mine are:- Michael/Dwight screwing over Prince Family Paper- The Scott's Tots dance- Clark being a creep to Erin- Oscar saying YOLO (and the product placement episode in general)- Andy and Pam yelling ""Say what?"" and ""Good to go!"" "
DunderMifflin,Or the Michael to your Holly

DunderMifflin,"David Wallace is actually an informant for the FBI to spy on creed, the 20-30 million dollars he made from, ‚Äúsuck it,‚Äù was actually the money he made for his work/exchange.  "
DunderMifflin,Question! How do you pronounce Cornell? End of question. 
DunderMifflin,"I recently realized that over the course of 9 seasons, 10 years, and multiple titles/positions, Ryan Howard literally never sells a single sheet of paper.  "
DunderMifflin,Happy(??) Friday the 13th! üëª  
DunderMifflin,"Where do Jo and Michael go on their plane ride? This has driven me nuts since the episode aired. They are at Dunder Mifflin, she drives him to the airport, they get on a plane and fly. And then next thing they are both back at DM. What is the deal with the plane ride?? "
DunderMifflin,"Just realized, after idk how many watch throughs, that Mr. Grotti used one of Michael's power moves by switching tables at their lunch meeting at the very last moment. Is that something or am I overthinking? Or was that the joke the whole time and I'm just an idiot?  "
DunderMifflin,"Rainn Wilson Mashup from The Office + Super about what is a hero . . . Years ago I saw a Mashup of Dwight doing the Hero speech from ""Diversity Day"" but it was cut with scenes from ""Super"". Does anyone know what I am talking about and where I might find it? "
DunderMifflin,"Mock-umentary Style, maybe put it to bed? I don't think we need any more ""mocumentary"" style TV shows. The Office perfected it, and also created a million imitators.Abbott Elementary is a lot of fun, and I'm glad they're getting the recognition, but I really think we need to retire this format.  Parks and Rec was a pure Office clone, full stop (crazy but lovable boss, etc. etc.).  What We Do In The Shadows is hilarious, but almost doesn't need to be a mocumentary. It's been a great run, but let's give it a rest. "
DunderMifflin,What would be Micheal‚Äôs way of dealing with Nellie if he was in Andy‚Äôs place?  
DunderMifflin,"Ive just finished The Office for the first time, are there any other anniversary episodes or something similar that i can watch? Or does it end here.  "
DunderMifflin,"It was me! I spray painted that dog! Oh my God... Dinner Party has always been my favorite episode. Finally watching the extended version and Jan's subplots have me cracking up harder than Creed's skull. If you haven't yet witnessed this delight, it's freaking phenomenal! "
DunderMifflin,Danny Cordray I haven‚Äôt really seen him discussed in this community and I thought his character was interesting. Sooooo thoughts on Danny? 
DunderMifflin,Watching this gem of a scene in ‚ÄúThe Seminar‚Äù. What do you think his presentation was gonna consist of if he wasn‚Äôt winded?  
DunderMifflin,s(o)rry for my bad engli(c)h  
DunderMifflin,It will always bother me that Jim orders a ham & cheese sandwich at Hooters.  
DunderMifflin,"This has me dying, everytime!  "
DunderMifflin,"In season 7, episode 15 why would Helene have called Jim before Pam? In ‚ÄúThe Search‚Äù Cece is sick and Helene calls Jim to tell him that she accidentally locked Cece in her car. Why wouldn‚Äôt she have called Pam first? I know this is what leads to losing Michael but it still doesn‚Äôt make sense. "

DunderMifflin,"Anyone realise when Wallace was interviewing Jim, he spoke the same way about his H.R Rep (Kendall) the way Michael speaks about Toby.  "
DunderMifflin,"Questions from a newbie Hi everyone,Just finished the series. And needed help figuring stuff out.1- How did Angela fake the results of the paternity test the first time around and then admit the Philip is his son later on?2- How come Dwight doesn't recognize the stripper at the restaurant even though they interacted quite a bit at the office and warehouse?3- Is there a way to access the superfan to episodes for those that don't live in the states?Thank you!

DunderMifflin,"Trivia episode Oscar might be a cocky douchebag‚Ä¶but I feel kind of bad for him in this episode.

DunderMifflin,Michael really should‚Äôve been in there the Office with the rest  
DunderMifflin,"In my infinite watches, my mind often plays the ‚Äúwhat if?‚Äù game, as in ‚ÄúWhat if Ryan had answered Russell from the Pancake Luncheon‚Äôs call?‚Äù He would have actually made one sale. What are some more (not-too-obvious) scenarios you can think of?  "
DunderMifflin,"Pam basically forcing Jim to talk to her father and get involved in something he had nothing to do with, was peak Pam nonsense. Especially getting mad at him after.  "

DunderMifflin,"I get being mad at the mess, but the real question is what is she microwaving??  "
DunderMifflin,"OK, I just have to ask: why all the hate for Andy? This has probably been asked here before, so I apologize if I'm retreading an old topic, but why is there so much hate for Andy?To me, even before he got sent to anger management and he was a douche at least he was entertaining to watch. And then when he came back he was actually a pretty decent guy for the most part until the writers dropped the ball with him (on purpose, it would seem.) I think he brought a lot of entertainment value to the show and that it wouldn't have been as good without him. Plus he had one of the most wholesome scenes in the entire show when he and Erin were in the junkyard and he looked at her almost in awe and said ""You're the nicest person I've ever met.""I don't know; Andy is one of my favorite characters. So, Andy haters, let me know what you're seeing that I'm not. "
DunderMifflin,Congratulations Luke! Evan Peters (aka Michaels nephew Luke) won a golden globe for his portrayal of Jeffery Dahmer [how serial killers are made]( 
DunderMifflin,"The Office [USA] is getting removed from Netflix in the UK apparently this month. Anyone else heard the same? It popped up on a Facebook post a few weeks ago and said something about Netflix cost cutting but I can‚Äôt find it any more so maybe it was a dream. I‚Äôm curious if anyone has heard similar, if so - how much time we‚Äôve got left and what the hell us Brits are going to do about it! "
DunderMifflin,"Robert California's list in s8e1 is actually a good read on each character For reference, [here is the list I'm talking about.]( separated them based off who he thought were winners and losers. After looking at the list, most of it is accurate with a few surprises snuck in, but overall I think its a good read on each character. One-by-one going down the list. WinnersJim - While he starts off the show lazy and complacent, he grows throughout the show in both his professional and personal life and strives to be more. He even starts his own company doing something he loves by the end of the show. Easy winner. Dwight - Best salesman and the most loyal right hand man out there who eventually becomes regional manager. Another easy winner. Oscar - Definitely the smartest in the office and an overall good friend that Kevin and eventually Angela both love, even if he comes off as a know-it-all. Darryl - Another smart and dedicated worker who is eventually promoted and leaves for something better. Even if Michael refused to see potential in him, it's clear he has it. Andy - This is the first interesting one, because if you remember the episode, he starts off on the winners list then in the middle of the episode gets erased and put on the losers side. I think this is a perfect metaphor for his character. On paper he is a smart guy, but in reality, he is not all he is cracked up to be. He comes from a rich family, graduated from Cornell and is clean cut and oozes success, but he consistently has the worst sales in the office and doesn't take his job seriously (especially when he went on the boating trip in season 9). Even in his love life, at first you root for him and Erin, but then you start rooting for Erin to leave the relationship. Him being erased off the winners list and added to the losers list is just right. Toby - Although sometimes he appears checked out and is a nervous wreck sometimes (see the whole secret crush on Pam story line) no one takes more shit from their boss than Toby yet he still had the cojones to come in every day and face a boss that was incredibly rude to him. Phyllis - May not be the best salesman, but she is the mother figure that everyone seemingly loves. How many people confide in her when they have a problem? Angela - While she comes off as rude, abrasive and cold hearted, you can't deny that she is a damn good worker. In s4e17, when Michael is at the job fair and Jim is at the golf course, everyone else in the office leaves except for who? Dwight and Angela! You can't take away her integrity. Also, there are two blank spaces on the losers side, I wouldn't be surprised if Robert California marked her as a loser at first because of her cold demeanor and switched her to the winners side. Kevin - This is another interesting one. Kevin is the exact opposite of Andy. Kevin appears to be the slowest and dumbest person at the office, but its obvious that people see something in him. In an episode in season 6, Michael admits to Erin (I think it was Erin) that Kevin interviewed for a warehouse job, but Michael hired him as an accountant because he saw something in him. Even after Kevin is fired by Dwight, he opens up a bar and by all accounts from the show, a successful one at that. It's also interesting that there are two blank spaces on the losers side of the list, I'm willing to bet that Kevin was one of those names that Robert California took a second look at and decided there was more to him that meets the eye. I think this theory is even further supported by the fact that Kevin is the last name on the winners list. LosersStanley - He is complacent and inattentive to anything going on. Constantly doing crossword puzzles instead of paying attention. Not hard to see why he would be a loser. Gabe - A nervous wreck who lets Jo dictate his life and walk all over him. He is most people's least favorite character and a clear loser. Kelly - Keeps going back to a guy who hates her and breaks her heart consistently who pretended to want to look for a c-suite role for a bit but never had any real drive to make something of herself and married and quit her job at the first opportunity when she married (or dated?) a doctor. Ryan - He show drive at first and then regressed when things got tough and rode off of Michael's kindness and love for him and got complacent in staying at the same job (if he even had a job there) for years. I think the whole corporate experience hurt Ryan more than he will ever admit, even to the point where he keeps going back to Kelly where its familiar, and it has unfortunately turned him into a loser. Old Man (AKA Creed) - Delirious and possibly psychopathic old man who was supposed to be fired in season 2 but swindled his way into keeping a job. He was also responsible for the inappropriate watermark drawing on all of their paper in season 3.Pam - Another one that I find interesting, but I also agree with. Pam may have grown a lot as a character during the series by leaving Roy and marrying Jim, but her professional life hasn't been as productive. She spent 5 season as a receptionist, she tried to become something more by attending art school but flunked out. She was promoted into bigger roles, but did she really earn these promotions? She left Dunder Mifflin to become a salesperson at Michael Scott Paper Company, which most people knew was a stupid decision, but was able to return as a salesperson. And before you call that a success, remember she failed at that job too and had to swindle her way into becoming an office administrator. These dishonest tactics is what got her a spot on the losers section.Meredith - Someone who slept with a guy for supplier discounts, is an alcoholic and by most accounts a terrible mother to a boy who eventually becomes a stripper. Not much else to say. Erin - While I find her friendly and her childish charm endearing, it feels like she is the least professional and didn't really show drive to be anything greater. She is also easily infatuated with people like Andy, Gabe and Michael. If she was one of the seven deadly sins, she would be lust. Robert California may have bought into the childish charm at first, because there is an empty space in the winners section, but once he realized there was not much else behind that charm, he switched her to the losers section. Let me know your thoughts are! "

In season 2‚Äôs episode ‚Äúthe Carpet,‚Äù Michael discovers that someone left a disgusting ‚Äúthing‚Äù in the middle of his carpet. It is implied that this ‚Äúthing‚Äù was a pile of poop, and it is later revealed that Todd Packer was the one who left it there. Before this reveal however, Michael talks to his former boss Ed Truck to get to the bottom of why someone would do that to his carpet. Ed tells him that someone once did that to his carpet as well when he was manager. We know that both Michael and Todd worked under Ed years ago, so is it possible that Todd Packer was the one who left the present on the carpet both times? "
DunderMifflin,My favorite Dwight moment.

The NBC streaming service has what is called ""Superfan Episodes"" with a fair amount of unused content from the original series, but because it's only on this streaming channel I've found a lot of folks aren't aware of them.  Have you heard of them? Have you watched them? "
DunderMifflin,I'm confused about Andy's printer problem. Why did he not tell the office before he told the newspaper? Why did he keep it secret that he told the news about burning printers? Have I forgotten something?

I vaguely remember that Micheal left before Andy punched the wall but he returned to see the hole in the wall. But in the Binge‚Äôs version, Andy punched the wall while Micheal there. I think it might be a different version from Netflix but I might be wrong lol.EDIT: Yup I remembered it wrong. Lol. Micheal was there when Andy punched the wall. Thanks guys. "

DunderMifflin,One of Dwight‚Äôs best lines IMO  
DunderMifflin,Our little temp has no shame in his kinks.  
DunderMifflin,Unpopular Office opinions? Steve Carell phoned in all of season six and season seven right up until Holly came back. The Office is easily a top twenty sitcom of all time but the obsessiveness of the fandom to treat it like it‚Äôs the only show that ever existed is a massive deterrent. The show could absolutely be made today you just would have to be smarter about the jokes. Dwight always secretly looking out for Pam was easily both his most redeeming and most wholesome quality. 
DunderMifflin,I see a lot of differing opinions on love/hate for Pam - but can we all agree that Season 5 had the best Pam?

DunderMifflin,"Honest opinions of Darryl? I mean , he texted Roy to make Micheal feel bad for wearing a woman‚Äôs suit. He forwarded Micheals photo with Jan to the entire company.

On the other hand, he drives Michael and Holly, he‚Äôs is a good father, and he seems like a character fans like. "

DunderMifflin,"Michael uncomfortable buying panty liners for Jan. But he bought them for himself in NY. I've been watching the extended episodes, during The Deposition, Michael purchases panty liners to put in his armpits during the deposition to soak up the sweat. There is a scene of him buying them for himself while in NY. A few episodes later, in Weight Loss Part 2,  there is a deleted scene where Jan is sitting in his office and has a list of things for Michael to do for her: Buy wicks, return a dress, and buy panty liners. Michael says he's doesn't want to buy panty liners. After she leaves, he tells Dwight to get the panty liners. "
DunderMifflin,"For once and for all, what is the best episode of 'The Office'? For me it's ""Goodbye Toby"". Holly's first day, her meeting Kevin, Phyllis who become head of the PPC, Toby freaking out cause no-one has a camera to take a picture of him and Pam "

Then 2 episodes later, S2E11, Booze Cruise, Jim actually brings Katie on the cruise w them. I mean he does break up w her for good in that episode‚Ä¶.

It needed more Michael though, he should be with the others when they were gathered in the office after the wedding.3) Did anyone else feel like it was too much Jim-Pam-centric?

DunderMifflin,I am going to say to my kids this is Salt Bae.  
DunderMifflin,"How old were Michael and Holly when they had their kids? Holly must have been 40-something right? They both seemed between 40 and 50 during the entire show, and they had kids between season 7 and 9. "
DunderMifflin,Re-watching and this moment killed me in S7 E10 - China  
DunderMifflin,This is one of my favorite scenes  
DunderMifflin,Does anyone agree that the Asian Jim prank is overrated? Maybe I'm in the minority here but I think that segment gets way too much praise when it was probably the least believable one on the show.. like we all know dwight gets easily fooled but even he can't be that stupid to fall for it. 
DunderMifflin,üëÄWhy were the office employees so nervous when dwight announced they were getting drug tested

DunderMifflin,He made money as a paper salesman but made even more money as a Thneed salesman  
DunderMifflin,"How was Dwight able to fire Toby, but Michael never could? I don't understand how Dwight was so easily able to fire Toby, as far as I'm aware, for no reason. But I recall multiple times that Michael tried to get rid of Toby, but was unable to, due to corporate red tape and labour laws etc. The only logical thing I  can think of is, that the documentary, that aired not long before Toby's termination maybe revealed some sort of probable cause to fire him? Idk, it's always kinda bothered me. And I think it is the one thing that truly makes Dwight the superior manager over THE MAN, THE MYTH, THE LEGEND, MICHAEL SCOTT! Please, I would like to hear your thoughts/theories. "
DunderMifflin,Im watching the show for the fisrt time and im in the forth season now AMA or tips?  
DunderMifflin,"It just occurred to me that Michael had to have another procedure to reverse his last vasectomy in order to have Kids with Holly. At the dinner party Michael said he had a vasectomy, had it reversed, and then had it again, leaving him sterile. So he had to have had his last vasectomy reversed! You have no idea the physical toll that four vasectomies have on a person! "
DunderMifflin,Michael was moving so fast I barley captured him!  
DunderMifflin,lol this was funny af.

DunderMifflin,"Fun fact: a 3 week hospital stay is enough time to watch the entirety of the office on comedy central. It‚Äôs on all the time. You have nothing else to do. I saw it 3 times. It would‚Äôve been  more times, but I was in a coma. "
DunderMifflin,"If The Office was still airing today, what topics do you think they would have covered? I can picture Michael getting caught up in a crypto pump and dump hyped up by Ryan; or maybe some right v left political satire; or Dwight vs marijuana legalization. "
DunderMifflin,"Do you think Todd Packer also left a ‚Äòpackage‚Äô in Ed Truck‚Äôs office? When Michael meets with Ed Truck after discovering a stank in his office Ed says ‚Äúyeah, somebody once did that in my office‚Äù, so the question needs to be asked: Do we think Todd Packer is a serial office pooper, or just a coincidence? "

I am currently teaching a unit to high school students on how to cut back and forth between two storylines in episodic television (specially within mockumentaries and reality tv.)While I know most episodes jump back and forth between different plot lines, I was curious to hear which one you would think would be the best one to show to my class as an example.Any suggestions are much appreciated!

DunderMifflin,Which character (in the show not real life) made the most money in the office - just curious Because Dwight shrute bought the building so he must have been making $100k plus at the time of saber commissions 
DunderMifflin,"Gf asked me what kind of relationship i would have with people if I worked at Dunder Mifflin and I thought it was fun so I share it here too Just an FYI I'm generally socially awkward and not super good with human relationships- Michael: I would probably laugh at his jokes but be uncomfortable around him most of the time- Jim/Pam/Toby : I'd be friendly at work but probably not much more- Dwight : We would probably have a few conversations about LOTR or Star Wars but I think he would be mean to me- Angela/Phyllis/Meredith/Stanley : I think I'd just say hello and ignore them- Kelly : I would date her but get exhausted quickly- Erin : I would try to date her but fail, probably- Kevin and Oscar could likely become friends of mine- Andy and Ryan would make me feel uncomfortable- Creed : I would day hello but probably not want to be in the same room as him "
DunderMifflin,The best 2 interviews for Michael Scott's replacement. Disagree with me.  
DunderMifflin,"the office over the generations Long time fans, those that were there from the beginning. When The Office first came out, what was your initial reaction? Was it an immediate hit? Did you follow it from episode 1? Did you immediately like it?I remember being really young and it playing on NBC in the background while I did grade school homework or when my parents cooked dinner. No idea that as a college student, it'd be one of my most beloved pieces of media ever. And I'm curious to see how the fan base grew over the years. "

DunderMifflin,In this episode was Jim a good salesman or too pushy?  
DunderMifflin,It makes sense  
DunderMifflin,Why do you think the office limited Kevin‚Äôs internet access?  
DunderMifflin,"I just finished ""13 Hours"" And I couldn't see John Krasinski as anything but Jim Halpert. But it still works! The character in the movie (Jack) is Jim Halpert, but many years later. He has two daughters, just like Jim. Pam must have passed away, so he remarried, but Pam's death left him broken and he did several tours with the military. We're just watching Jim run around Benghazi, years after Athlead and Dunder Mifflin. Good movie, but I had to come up with some headcannon because it's still just.... Jim. "

DunderMifflin,"Over Dec and up to earlier this afternoon I binged The Office I never watched it when it was aired, not a single episode, but it was something I was aware of as it was such a huge cultural phenomenon.  Looking for something new, I watched the first four episodes, but didn't think it was all that great. A week later, I watched the fifth episode and that was it, I was hooked. I finished it off earlier today, and I am absolutely wrecked. I don't think I've ever watched anything that celebrated the true joy of living just a normal life like it did.""I wish there was a way to know you were in the good old days before you actually left them."" - Andy Bernard "

DunderMifflin,What was the most hypocritical thing Angels has said or done?  
DunderMifflin,"Why didn‚Äôt Michael fire Toby in the halloween episode? I was rewatching the office and in the halloween ep (s2ep5) Michael had to fire one employee and he went with Devon. But why not Toby? The man practically wanted him dead, why not fire him when he had the chance? We know that Jan didn‚Äôt give him any restriction on which department he can fire. Then why not Toby? I just don‚Äôt get it. "
DunderMifflin,"""oh no, he's baaack! hmmm... waaaah!"" I had a hard time getting the face to look like him, but anyways, this is one of my favorite moments lol  "

DunderMifflin,"Nice Guy Is it just me or do other people agree with this?Jim has displayed some nice guy tendencies for starters he was upset with Pam when he 1st revealed his love for her and she said I'm sorry you misinterpreted our friendship, even though he obviously knew she was engaged. And he obviously only started dating Karen out of spite, because he was going back to The Office and wanted to seem like he was over Pam. Not to mention he started dating Karen knowing he was still in love with Pam. Anyway there are other little things but those are the ones that stand out the most. Don't get me wrong I love Jim and Pam together and I love them separately I just think he comes off niceguyish sometimes. "

DunderMifflin,"Does the Peacock version of The Office have a lot more scenes than the Netflix version? I am rewatching the show for the billionth time and I keep seeing snips of the show I don't remember seeing before. For example in S7 E22 (Michael's last day before he leaves for Colorado), Michael starts crying in the break room and throws his boots in the trash. Also he videochats David Wallace who tells Michael moving to Colorado is a bad idea. I do have a newborn so my brain might be scrambled but I seriously feel like the Peacock version has a lot of new scenes in it... "

DunderMifflin,Lets speculate what kind of contract did the camera team had with Dunder Mifflin? They would not inter-fare with the any of the activities of the office and their employees. They can film the personal aspects of life of the employees. They can‚Äôt help or interrupt anyone even if they are in danger. 
DunderMifflin,"Unpopular opinion(maybe). I wanted to see more of Deangelo Everyone gives Deangelo a bad rap. He's inconsistent is usually the biggest complaint. I think if he had more time, and was written to be like if he and Michael were to be childhood friends, I think he could've been a great character. Michael tends to be ignorant, and Deangelo could be the childish one. Season 1 Michael is awful and cringey in every way, but we grew to love him. I think the same could happen to Deangelo. "
DunderMifflin,"So why didn't Dwight come for Michael's rescue? Why didn't Dwight come for Michael's rescue when those frat guys threw stuff at Michael in chili's? (Dundies episode)  Everybody just stood there by watching, that I can understand, But how come Dwight was doing the same? "

DunderMifflin,"The irony of unpopular opinions so um, is everyone conveniently forgetting that this is a COMEDY show, relying on second hand embarrassment and racist, sexist, offensive humour. if everyone was so morally perfect, what would the plots be? and, they‚Äôre all flawed to the core. stanley cheating on his wife, angela being the typical stingy religious person whose rules only apply to others, michael‚Äôs attitude towards women is extremely harass-y, creed clearly has committed some serious crimes, meredith is a terrible mother, oscar betrayed angela, phyllis is the meanest pos, and so much more, but somehow all anyone can do here is call out jim and pam for their very normal shortcomings and label it unpopular opinion. been consistently seeing these posts for the last three days. again, my point is, they all have flaws. like every human being on the planet has flaws. this is a really great satire on an office‚Äôs atmosphere tbh, it‚Äôs so real. they just make the characters likeable is all. "
DunderMifflin,One of the least appreciated wholesome moments of the show  
DunderMifflin,I can't be the only crossover fan  
DunderMifflin,Kelly is hotter than Pam.  
DunderMifflin,Toby Flenderson is everything that‚Äôs wrong with the paper industry  
DunderMifflin,So‚Ä¶ what language did Creed speak to Jordan?  
DunderMifflin,"Almost done with my first watch thru and man, Brian absolutely blasted Pam‚Äôs cheeks. No doubt in my mind. "
DunderMifflin,What do you guys think Andy Dwight and Micheal did after they all died? how long did they play dead?  
DunderMifflin,its already been a decade since the office ended  
DunderMifflin,Date Mike uses a very flexible pool cue  
DunderMifflin,"6 months between Season 2 and season 3 I couldn't imagine waiting to find out what happened between the Jim and Pam kiss and what the rest of the story. PS The amount of the cold open of first episode of season 3 that is cur out that is cut out on cable makes it pretty much unwatchable, makes Mindy Kaling seem much more reasonable then people on this sub made her seem. "
DunderMifflin,the caption says Rainn instead of Dwight and we all know identity theft is not a joke  
DunderMifflin,Actual question Why did Jim get the teapot for Pam together if he was still dating Katy on the booze cruise (which is the following episode)? I know they break up then. But JIMEdit: I forgot about Jim‚Äôs barbecue confession to Ryan about Katy 
DunderMifflin,What is this on the wall of the kitchen by the trash can? Noticed it in ‚ÄúBlood Drive‚Äù  
DunderMifflin,Chart of talking head interviews across all 9 seasons  
DunderMifflin,"AITA for eating a hard boiled egg at my desk for lunch? One of my coworkers is pregnant. She and her husband, another coworker and all around idiot, made an announcement today regarding her touchy stomach due to her condition. It seemed to be an honest PSA, but it was actually very condescending and judgmental. I mean, I deserve the right to peel my hard boiled eggs at my desk. As an aside, another coworker mentioned her daily cigar and that she didn‚Äôt want to give that up either; so I‚Äôm not the only one upset by this. Anyways, I decided to eat my egg anyways. I mean, how can one person - a failed art student - dictate what the top salesman can and cannot eat? I was enjoying my egg, and she ended up puking a little bit in the trash can by her desk. It didn‚Äôt stop there. Another one of our salesman (who doesn‚Äôt even know how to protect people from bears) started puking too. Then the air-headed receptionist puked, followed by one of our accountants - who I think may have been a drug mule. Pretty soon everyone was puking. I know this isn‚Äôt my fault, but twinkledee and twinkle-dumbass seem to blame me. AITA? "
DunderMifflin,Andy the whistleblowing psychopath from Cornell  
DunderMifflin,How did Andy get rid of Gabe after this  
DunderMifflin,S1 Michael is painfully uncomfortable to watch  
DunderMifflin,"IDK why, I just really enjoy this reaction of Jordan from Creed's insanity  "
DunderMifflin,KEEP GRINDING

DunderMifflin,Watching the super fan episodes for the first time I finally got a roommate who has peacock so I‚Äôm watching the super fan episodes (there‚Äôs 5 seasons? I had no idea!) and there is so much extra content it‚Äôs amazing. I‚Äôve watched the series 8 times all the way through and can fully quote any episode and I never thought I would get new content. Like actual scenes I hadn‚Äôt seen before. This is actually amazing.

DunderMifflin,"Season 8 warehouse lotto winners I know every show can have some writing flaws, but how unrealistic is it that you would quit your job if you won a hundred and some thousand dollars? I can see maybe 1 or 2 people quitting, but all of them? It‚Äôs always bothered me when I come back around to that episode. "
DunderMifflin,"help with EP duration (streaming divergences) I only met the office in 2018 and watched the whole series in the same yearnow in 2023 I decided to watch it again however I see some Ep duration differencesI researched here and it seems that there are 4 types versions  The one that aired on TV weekly on the NBC channel  The DVD version that was released after each season ended  The dvd and bluray version with all seasons together with some deleted scenes and commentary      by actors and directors the peacock version (superfan) that came out now in 2021 on NBC streaming where all ep have      extra scenes and most that had 22min rose to the 32min rangeI want to exclude the Peacock (superfan) version from the discussion and focus on the first 3 versions that I quotedSearching here about it I saw that the first season is all right on all streaming with all 6 ep lasting 22 minutesIn the second season that starts the problem, ep 5 Halloween of the second season on IMDB says it has 30 min however on streaming services like VUDU and AMAZON it says it has 22 minIn the third season, ep 7 Branch Closing on the IMDB site says it has 30 minutes. On the other hand, the AMAZON streaming service has 22 minutes while VUDU streaming has 30 minutes.Can someone explain to me the reason for this divergence between ep S02E05 Halloween and EP S03E07 Branch Closing "
DunderMifflin,New season of the Office?!?! Netflix had me fooled this morning. I still don't know what that tag was about.  
DunderMifflin,Crappy guy trying to get out of paying Kevin  
DunderMifflin,Life imitates art  
DunderMifflin,Dwight K. Schrute is the rightfull king of the Seven Kingdoms.  
DunderMifflin,Sometimes Phyllis really had some savage comebacks  
DunderMifflin,"Anyone else notice that Michael only ever discusses Cheating while he's in parking lots? No matter who's involved/cheating, he moves the convo to a parking lot (typ the Dunder Mifflin one, but not exclusively)  "
DunderMifflin,What did y‚Äôall think about Billie‚Äôs interview on The Office Ladies?  
DunderMifflin,"Theory: After noticing that Brian had become involved in the lives of the subjects, the producers of the documentary gave instructions to the camera crew to film him whenever he was acting weird.  "
DunderMifflin,"Okay, but which savage cameraman decided to focus on him swooning at Pam during Jim speaking on being close to those around you?  "
DunderMifflin,"Sometimes I find myself singing Andy and the Tuna, for no reason. "
DunderMifflin,Perfect Branch Manager Material Caught in the wild! 
DunderMifflin,"Where would Ryan be today? So Ryan essentially went through so many different phases on the show. At one point he was anti-vax and other times he seemed like he would judge someone for being anti-vax. Which made me wonder where he would be today? Would he be all up in the alpha male stuff and listen to Andrew Tate? would he big into Elon musk? Or would he be total opposite? A Tiktoker? Or one of those people that goes to live off in the wilderness with some random people? So many ideas, I feel like he would follow the whole Andrew Tate stuff and the moment and be really annoying about it as well. What do y‚Äôall think? Also I tagged spoiler just in case people don‚Äôt know about Ryan‚Äôs spiraling. "
DunderMifflin,"I used to think that I was the Karen, my boyfriend was the Jim, and his ex girlfriend who he never, ever stopped reminiscing about, was the Pam. But I realize now - that I am the Pam. And my boyfriend is the Roy. Which storyline can you relate to?  "

DunderMifflin,So hard not to hijack this post with Creed references!  
DunderMifflin,"Nobody ever talks about how infuriating Pam and Jam are. They are both terrible people. Jim harasses his coworkers constantly, went after his best friend who was about to be MARRIED, and he said point blank to his girlfriend (Karen) that he loved Pam and still lied to her and told her that he loved her. Although Roy is terrible, two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right. Pam cheated on Roy, encourages Jim to harass Dwight and he goes after Jim knowing that she‚Äôs in a relationship! I can‚Äôt stand them the more times I watch the show "
DunderMifflin,"Just some news about Cugino‚Äôs that I‚Äôm not sure was ever shared here I live in the Scranton area and I‚Äôm not sure if anyone ever posted about this, but I wanted to let diehards, fans, and future Office Travelers the news.In May of 2022, after the death of the chef/owner, Cugino‚Äôs closed permanently. Shout out to Cugino‚Äôs, who they loved for the tasty bread, and where Jim & Pam went on their fake first date according to Jim in deleted scenes. "
DunderMifflin,"Andy did nothing wrong‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶by not telling Erin about his past with Angela. It‚Äôs not like he was in a serious relationship yet with Erin, and it may not have been a good time to talk about such a serious topic like cheating. And I get that Erin is a weirdo and her reactions are atypical, but everyone in the office acted like Andy messed up. Am I missing something? "

It reminded me of the way some people on the sub view her, I liked that she stood up for herself with the last question! Not trying to start anything just something I noticed. "
DunderMifflin,Something to think about  
DunderMifflin,"What kind of cake do you want? Okay someone please help me out. I'm trying to send my girlfriend an email that is entirely Dwight quote screenshots (but with some MS Paint for certain words). I know there's an episode where Dwight says ""What kind of cake do you want, idiot?"" or something like that. I thought it was when he and Jim are heads of the Party Planning Committee and throwing Kelly (Kelley) a party, but I can't find the quote online and maybe I'm not remembering the right episode because there are so many great Dwight moments.Does anyone know where that occurs? Thanks so much! "

DunderMifflin,How did Dwight actually want the office to escape the fire?  
DunderMifflin,"Could this Office reboot work? Here‚Äôs how I would reboot ‚ÄúThe Office‚Äù ‚Äî Dwight is the manager, and he manages a new group of millennials and gen Z workers at Dunder Mifflin. The show revolves Dwight‚Äôs personality and management style and how it clashes with the current work culture. Some of the old regulars could pop in and out from time to time but the show would mainly be new characters. Do you think this would work? "
DunderMifflin,Jim's dad reading the rundown list he received by fax  
DunderMifflin,"If Michael hates Toby how does he know such specific details about his favorite things? In S6 E14 ""The Banker""Michael says  ""I left a copy of best American mystery stories 1999 in Toby's favorite stall"" This seems like so much personal info (even knowing the stall he uses is odd even if you like the person) to know by Michael when he never wants to deal with anything that involves Toby.

DunderMifflin,What was a heartfelt moment that was ruined by a joke? For me The Nine Hundred eighty six thousand minutes Song was ruined by Deangelo‚Äôs singing.

Later on, while Pam was giving Michael a ride home, he mentioned that he was wearing someone's shoes! It only took me 90+ rewatches to realize this! "
DunderMifflin,"Need help finding a similar show. Currently on the 17th rewatch Currently in a very stressful grad school and I binge rewatch shows like the office to relieve that stress (because it provides a cozy homely feeling idk how to explain it). Some examples of shows I‚Äôve rewatched a million times include: B-99, Parks and Rec, and New Girl. Does anyone have any show recommendations that are similar to this genre of shows? "

Ryan - 'I felt terrorized'  Toby - 'Oh! There's a whole terrorism thing for that' (smiles at the camera)Made me think that would be the reason Michael hated him so much, because of all the other forms Toby made him fill LOL "

DunderMifflin,Billie Eilish is on this weeks Office Ladies podcast  
DunderMifflin,"Charles Miner Theory Given that Michael and Charles met previously in the NY corporate office and got along great, my theory is that after that meeting, David Wallace and the rest of the higher ups took Charles aside and told him that they thought Michael was a screw up and they only kept him around because of his consistent numbers.  Charles, being the brown noser he is later exposed as, decides it's in his best interest to sever the friendship with Michael, so as not to be tainted, and try to ""whip him into shape"" and make him more professional in order to score brownie points with Wallace, et al. Eventually, the adversarial relationship completely destroys any sympathy he may have had at the beginning and with Michael constantly undermining everything Charles tries to do, brings out his wrath because he's trying to prove himself to corporate and Michael won't cooperate in any way. I think at the meeting in NY before he was pulled aside, he genuinely liked Michael. Ps- side trivia- the street the sound stage they filmed on was Saticoy Street. "
DunderMifflin,"Some weird pavlovian conditioning while watching the show I just noticed some kind of weird pavlovian conditioning while showing the Office to my gf for the first time. I discovered the show like 5 years ago and usually watch it when I'm kinda sad or depressed. Here is the strange thing: out of this estate where I usually watch the Office, I made my gf discover the show, and I suddenly felt sad for no apparent reason. That's what I suspected some kind of conditioning response, like: because you usually watch the Office while being sad, now that you're watching it randomly, you're going to be sad. Am I the only one ahah ? "

DunderMifflin,Am I the only one that feels a little sympathy towards Meredith‚Äôs son? I feel that he was a nice guy in the show and just grew up doing horrible things due to a broken family. In his first appearance he gets suspended and has no respect for Meredith or to anyone at the office. He is then described to have pooped on the top of the toilet and gotten a face tattoo in later seasons. In season 8 and 9 he actually tries to get Meredith‚Äôs attention and tries to get a family photo with her. His last appearance is as a stripper where he finally calls Meredith mom.

DunderMifflin,"Benihana couple - food share When the group goes to the restaurant, why doesn‚Äôt the husband just move? He can immediately see the cross conversation but incloses himself with his wife. Who in hell sits there and says ‚ÄúThis is fine‚Äù. He deserves food being taken off his plate right? He can clearly see that there is a group meeting, but invites himself (not his wife) to sit in between them (which THEN includes his wife).Doing so automatically puts him in the rightful realm of Michael Scott‚Äôs craziness. So even the side comment of his wife is now deserving of Dwight‚Äôs aggression. That couple, set themselves up, and deserve all issues that happened in that restaurant. "
DunderMifflin,"Why did no one think of calling Bob Vance (Of Vance Refrigeration) When everyone was locked in the office in S4E15 Night Out why did Phyllis not call Bob Vance (Of Vance Refrigeration)? As one of the members of the five families of the Scranton Business park, he should have access to a spare key to the front gate. Given his low opinion of Michela and his shenanigans, it seems likely that he would keep a key handy as the folks of Dunder Mifflin getting locked in seems very reasonable.Alternatively, if he did not have a key he has the personality that would just cut the lock off, and then pay for a replacement. Regardless of Bob Vance‚Äôs (Of Vance Refrigeration) actions, he would respond much faster the Hank. "

DunderMifflin,"What's your favourite cold open? (For those unaware - cold open is the pre-title credit bit)For me, it's the 'What will Stanley notice?' bit, after he drunk Jim's OJ not noticing it wasn't his coffee.... Just every bit was hilarious.... "

DunderMifflin,Finale viewing party ideas This weekend I am going to be watching the series finale with my 13yo daughter. We have been watching the show together for over a year now. It‚Äôs her first watch and my first full rewatch since the show originally aired and we are very excited to have reached the end.To make the occasion a little bit more special I would like to have a finale viewing party potentially with themed food and (non-alcoholic) drinks.Any suggestions? 
DunderMifflin,"Benihana Christmas Episode Any mention of this episode it‚Äôs always about how the waitresses are different actors but what always bugged me about this is the other two people who sat at the Benihana table with Michael, Andy, Jim, and Dwight. I mean they had to have known Dwight was with michael and them but sat in between them anyway. Yes Dwight is not always publicly aware of himself but they could‚Äôve scooted over 1 seat and could‚Äôve been separated. "

DunderMifflin,"Secretary's Day changed how I view Jim and Pam Remember the episode where they bully Kevin (because of the Cookie Monster thing) and then are kinda rewarded with 2 days off with pay because Gabe's plan backfires? It really annoys me how Gabe was made out to be the bad guy, when he was only trying to defend Kevin...To be clear: this isn't some sort of Jim and Pam hate post or anything like that, at the end of the day, I still like both characters, but I hated them in that episode, and it's probably my least favorite in the entire series.

DunderMifflin,What if The Office ended at season 3? There was a pretty heated discussion among my friend group when The Office should have ended. Majority argued S3. What do you guys think. I personally loved s5 and s6. I mean Jim and Pams wedding is a must see. But I feel like the show ending on Pam smiling happily at the camera is also a good way to end it idk. I feel like as the show went on the more cartoony it became. 
DunderMifflin,"Hot Take: Dwight is a better employee, character and a person than Jim. Fact. Dwight owns land, has his own farm, runs a bed and breakfast, has family, owns the building, has a backbone, stands up for himself, is consistently the salesman with the highest sales AND his scenes always make me laugh.   Jim is extremely predictable. You know he is not going to stand up for himself in any situation, he is a slacker and most of his time is spent planning pranks on dwight (even when he was in Stamford). He is extremely passive, didn't hit the numbers he needed to pay for New York for Pam and just wafts through life. Even as a manager, he failed. He wasn't decisive at all. Thank you, and let the downvoting begin. "

DunderMifflin,"#justice4gabe i‚Äôve felt sorry for him since the beginning (toby first but it was only one person hating him) but i completely blacked out how much erin hurt/humiliated him in front of everyone. i know it‚Äôs a ‚Äûdifferent time‚Äú but no one else was made fun of as much as gabe was in their face. his height, job, weight, face etc. i mean kevin too. difference is  99% of the jokes came from michael if not it was from people he‚Äôd worked with for 10+ years (doesn‚Äôt change how backwards the jokes were about his IQ or weight) if he did feel uncomfortable about something he did say something (except when packer was ‚Äûworking‚Äú there) like the cookie monster he said something about it. with gabe it‚Äôs just different they hate him for hating him. he‚Äôs just trying to do his job. yeah he‚Äôs an absolute wet wipe but he gets shat on so much more than anyone else- that i can think of right now, for just existing. him having a baby face doesn‚Äôt help either because i just feel even more sorry for him. especially in S07A21 14:38 ‚Äî i just want to cry "

Dwight: This one, from David Wallace to all. Hello everyone I am sure you have seen the item in the Journal. I just want to stress that it's all conjecture. If there's any concrete news you will know ASAP. Michael: Erin, do we have the journal? Erin: Your feelings journal? You told me to put it in the time capsule. Michael: Did you?

DunderMifflin,I need help identifying an episode! I remember a scene were Michael was saying something and Pam goes a long with it. Then Jim says something contrary and Michael gets annoyed and Pam just shakes her head in like a mocking disapproving way.  I hope that makes sense. Does anyone know the episode? 
DunderMifflin,"The hardest I've ever laughed at a cold open Was when Dwight gives birth to the watermelon baby and Michael immediately drops and breaks it. ""Wow, what was on that?""""Butter, newborns are slippery!""""Nice touch, good.""And then hard cut to Michael chowing on the buttermelon with Dwight pulling his pants up right behind him.

DunderMifflin,"Jim and Kevin scene in 'Email Surveillance' I have a distinct memory of Jim and Kevin in the break room where Kevin asks Jim if he can bring his fiancee to Jim's party, but on my last re-watch I didn't see it. Was it a deleted scene? I know it's in the original script. Or maybe I just blinked and missed it lol. I always liked that scene because it makes it clear that Jim didn't ask Pam if Roy was coming for numbers reasons. "

DunderMifflin,"Help Stanley question In the first couple of episodes in Season 1, it appears there‚Äôs a skinny version of Stanley, and a regular one. Can someone help me answer this? "
DunderMifflin,"Plot Problem So when Jim answers Pam's question on the first thing she said to him, he said it was when she led him to his desk and said remember this moment because it will be the last time you didn't know your desk make Dwight.  But in the episode ""The Secret"" he said he had a crush when she started working at Dunder Mifflin.  So who started first at Dunder Mifflin, Jim or Pam? "
DunderMifflin,Welcome mints! Since 1812  
DunderMifflin,"Business Meeting plot hole I'm doing another rewatch and in the episode 'Business Meeting', Jans tells Michael that their meeting with Christian (played by Tim Meadows) should take no longer than an hour. But the next morning, Michael tells the camera crew that he and Jan went back to her hotel room and made out and she fell asleep on his arm. After picking up her car from the office Jan heads back to New York, calling Michael  (as evidenced by the fact that he asks her ""how's traffic"") at some point during the two hour drive.Why would Jan have booked a hotel room for a business meeting that she fully anticipated would only take an hour or so? Especially since it's supposed to be a lunch meeting, she would have had plenty of time to do the hour long meeting and the two hour drive back to NY and still arrive back at Corporate before the end of the work day. So why did she book a hotel? And did she pay for it or did Corporate? Make it make sense! "
DunderMifflin,It‚Äôs big pregs and little pregs!!  
DunderMifflin,Dwight? Stop following that cat.  
DunderMifflin,One of the most quoted lines in my household. Hope everyone‚Äôs new year is starting off like Kevin‚Äôs!  
DunderMifflin,It's easy to forget that Michael is an elite salesperson. Just watching Traveling Salesmen and Michael is so on point and serious when he gets down to business.  They always show his skill when he goes on sales calls and he has awards to back it up.  He's hopeless in so many other areas of his life but he's always been the best at this.

DunderMifflin,Question about Jim‚Äôs trip There is an episode (S2 E17?) where Jim is asking people for suggestions on a trip he wants to take. Toby mentions he went to Amsterdam but seemed confused by the length of his stay.Was this scene implying he was heavily under the influence of drugs during his visit? 
DunderMifflin,Creed thoughts  
DunderMifflin,Is this a deleted scene?  
DunderMifflin,What‚Äôs your favorite season? I think a lot of people may go 3 but I give 5 the slight edge. The arrival of  Charles as well as the entire Michael Scott Paper Company arc and then Cafe Disco just seal the deal for me. What‚Äôs you‚Äôre and why?

I‚Äôm 27 nowand this is such a different show to me. now that i‚Äôm older and understand ‚Äúadult relationships‚Äù more. i have a different sense of emotional and social lifelike michael and jan are so different to me now. watching pam, karen and jim is so different. now that i know what‚Äôs it‚Äôs like to be in a relationship and have coworkers. things have a new layerwhen i was 14 i just thought jam and michael were a bad relationship. i didn‚Äôt think anything of it.but now as an adult i see an insecure and self destructive woman attaching herself to michael who is equally destructive for her. their dialogue is so sad now that i have a more grown up point of view. it‚Äôs like a completely differently show. in a very good way. it‚Äôs like there‚Äôs a new level to it that i didn‚Äôt understand as a teenager.when i was 14 it was just a funny office show. now that i‚Äôm an adult it‚Äôs so much more sad, awkward and still funny "

DunderMifflin,One of my favorite scenes  
DunderMifflin,"Just like The Office, whats 1 thing in your office/work norm or something that happened in your work environment that would be considered illegal, weird, fcked up, doesnt matter, you get the gist. Just tell me your most messed up and weird work norms and stories like The Office.Mine: Like 99% of the males at my work place have a real strong comradery that if any of us do something good or over the line, we slap each others asses. Yes, just like the old school dam football team.Also one time, me and my manager were talking about squats because were huge gym nerds. Then we got in kind of  heated argument on who had the stronger ass, and our HR walked right past us watching each other just feeling each others butts. Big Facepalm, but i won in the end so it was worth it.Also one coworker slept with 3 other coworkers, that is what you would call, ""someone who took the slow train from philly""So yea, alot of sexual harassment going on in my workplace, i guess "
DunderMifflin,"What did Robert California do? Before interviewing for the regional manager job in Scranton (and then somehow convincing Jo Bennett to make him the CEO), it is implied that he had other business success:- He met his current (and then most recent divorced) wife when he was the boss at her old job- Bought a massive house in Scranton- ‚ÄúThe 1% are suffering too, people‚Äù- He‚Äôs received the call to accept a job many times before (by his own admission)So I ask you all: What jobs/job titles & where do you think Robert California aka Bob Kazamakis worked before coming to Scranton, and then leaving to mentor college-aged gymnasts?

DunderMifflin,"In Safety Training, Michael talks to Dwight in the hallway outside the office about his plan to illustrate depression. Dwight‚Äôs first response of ‚ÄúIdiots. God what are we gonna DO!‚Äù gets me every-time and perfectly encapsulates his relationship with Micheal. What‚Äôs your favorite little moment?  "
DunderMifflin,unpopular opinion..... Michael's ignorance and stupidity makes him attractive lol.  He's very carasmatic. I think if I were in a relationship with Michael Scott everyday would be funny.  It would be very unpredictable.

DunderMifflin,"Was there a cap on commissions from the beginning of sabre? First time watching the show (it‚Äôs great) and Jim recently declined the role as regional manager due to making more money as a salesman as there is no cap on commissions. Few episodes later and Jim can‚Äôt really keep on making sales due to him reaching his cap on commissions (he could have given his sales to his wife, just saying). What‚Äôs the deal here? "
DunderMifflin,I Remade The Office (UPDATE 2)  
DunderMifflin,"Gritty The Office reboot. Hear me out. The year is 2032. Gen Z is just reaching the age where they realize being an adult is the worst, so they try to cure it with nostalgia. This reboot will attract lots of eyes and dollars, so like everything else it will be ruined by capitalism.Starring: Larry the cable guy as Michael Scott. Scenes will be interspersed with commentary by an AI hologram of Richard Pryor (brought to you by Pepsi)It will air on HBO, So there will be some nudity. The full original cast will be naked at some point, no CGI or body doubles. Steve Carrell will appear as a pizza delivery in a sort of throwback episode.You will feast your eyes on Naked Stanley, is what I'm trying to tell you. Naked as the day he was born, with a pretzel and a mischievous look in his eye. I'm open to more ideas to flesh this out, but my last idea is that Roy shoots Jim, and he's in the hospital for a whole season during the trial to convict Roy for attempted murder, which the whole office attends to testify, to hilarious results. Thoughts? "
DunderMifflin,This is by far the biggest cringe moment in all of Office history! [Phyllis's Wedding]  
DunderMifflin,"Patrice O‚ÄôNeal/Lonnie Lonnie from the warehouse was a bit character for a couple of seasons played by legendary comedian (RIP) Patrice O‚ÄôNeal. He was just quietly scrapped from the cast after the first few seasons and in interviews while alive said he was never given a reason for why. Once odd things I‚Äôve noticed is during Office Ladies, even when discussing episodes he had a big part in (Basketball, Safety Training), he‚Äôs never mentioned by name, almost intentionally. Anyone know the whole Lake Monster story here? "

Jim Halpert is a menace.Erin (Season 8, Episode 10)I want.. my sugar free cookie, and then I want a sugar cookie. And then I want my nap!Please correct me if i'm missing any! "
DunderMifflin,"I really like that after Dwight met Troy in season 4 and called him a hobbit, he was apparently included in Dwight's friend circle, as they all seemed familiar with him. Maybe Wolf executed him at point-blank range, too. Very heart-warming.  "
DunderMifflin,"Season 6 really isn‚Äôt good. I know this isn‚Äôt news, but my wife and I just finished it in one of our many rewatches and it is a huge mess. It has no ambition. It doesn‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a season about Jim and Pam getting married/having a baby, if it‚Äôs about Sabre, if it‚Äôs about Michael sleeping with a married woman, if it‚Äôs about Sabre printers blowing up, etc. There is so much that happens and none of it is all that interesting. I remember watching it when it was brand new and not liking it, but I thought I‚Äôd go in with an open mind this time around. Well, I still don‚Äôt care for it.All of these massive flaws could be forgiven if the season was funny, but it isn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not saying it doesn‚Äôt have its moments, they are just few and far between. Steve Carell looks like he‚Äôs got bigger fish on his mind - he literally has his Dinner for Schmucks haircut in a few episodes, thus proving he was quite busy at the time - which means that the rest of the cast has to step up to the plate and the writing does not support them well. The supporting cast is quite annoying in this season and it‚Äôs clear because they have to do a lot of the heavy lifting.I was reading about this season last night and I learned that comedy legend Greg Daniels, who was a driving force of the first five seasons, had a limited role due to him focusing most of his time on Parks and Recreation. That makes sense because this is where The Office started to go downhill and Parks and Recreation was beginning to take off.Anywho, rant over. Who‚Äôs with me? "

DunderMifflin,"As much as I like Catherine Tate, Nellie has got to be the worst main character in the whole show. Especially when she arrives at Scranton at first.  "
DunderMifflin,Who has failed at their resolutions already?  
DunderMifflin,Pam's mom got a hell of a face-lift!  
DunderMifflin,"female humans who're over 30, a question about Jan's relationship with Michael Was it realistic that her being embarrassed at Michael's antics, and being this stern, authoritative lady at the beginning and him being a rebellious, off the wall kind of guy with no self-awareness, a turn on for her?Like she secretly enjoyed him being petulant and not compliant with her? Like he was cringeworthy, do you think it's realistic a woman can secretly like such antics? "
DunderMifflin,Tell me a todd packer moment where you laughed your ass off. For me it is why don't witches wear panties joke? 
DunderMifflin,"Topical references the non-US audience watching nowadays may not understand.. I'm from the UK, and I first got into watching the show maybe 5-6 years ago. Obviously the show is successful, made it to 9 seasons, and it's enjoyed all over the world - I re-watch it all the time! But I bet there's jokes and scenes that have much more context than I realise, due to topical references and generally stuff that was going on at the time in the US that isn't well known nowadays (especially to non-US audiences). Have you got any examples? e.g. scandals at the time, 'nods' to other TV shows or celebrities, political references, or even references that haven't aged well. "
DunderMifflin,Should I tell her?  
DunderMifflin,"When Angela finally let Andy take her on a date... She specifically mentioned: no bars, no patios, no seafood & no vegetables. A vegetarian that doesn't like vegetables? ü§î "
DunderMifflin,"BOYCOT THE STEAM TOWN MALL! Good sir‚Ä¶ after a long day I came into your establishment, thank you, YOUVE MADE A MISTAKE HUGE‚Ä¶  "
DunderMifflin,"Best/Favorite ""aware"" Michael scene? I'm specifically referring to moments where Michael who as we know normally lacks the social awarness to navigate a rough situation handles it in such a normal manner that [at least to me] is funny because it's Michael of all people.For example the episode that made me think about this is Season 6 Episode 22 where Michael drops that Andy dated Angela, he spends most of the episode being the straight man to the absurdity. Such as when he of all people tells Andy to stop talking as he praises Angela. "
DunderMifflin,"Angela and Andy (hear me out) I feel that Angela was never interested in dating/marryin Andy. She‚Äôs said that she‚Äôs someone who keeps a grudge. She didn‚Äôt speak to her sister for 16 years (S. 3 E. 10-11). Andy, when he joined, lead Dwight to be resign when he was helping Angela (S. 3 E. 13). Everyone forgot about this when Dwight joined back. But not Angela. When Andy started flirting, she said yes just for revenge. She uses every opportunity to harasshumiliate Andy. The entire arch of her relationship with Andy is not her being indecisive or a ‚Äòcheater, tramp or woman who breaks Rolf‚Äôs friend‚Äôs heart‚Äô. She deliberately and meticulously planned her entire tryst with Andy as revenge for his actions. "
DunderMifflin,when will we get new super fan season on peacock?

DunderMifflin,"Is there a list of Superfan differences? Wife and I are doing a rewatch and started the Superfan ones at season 4. I‚Äôve heard about some good changes/additions to S3 storylines - Roy, Kelly/Ryan/Dumpster, Oscar hire story, etc. - but is there a list somewhere walking through all the changes so far? Haven‚Äôt had any luck online or Reddit, just bits and pieces here and there. "
DunderMifflin,"How have Dwight & Michael not been arrested? People constantly point out Dwight or Michael should've been fired for the things they've done, but a bigger question is, why haven't they been arrested? I mean, things like kidnapping a delivery boy, running Meredith over with his car, causing Meredith to get rabies, giving Stanley a heart attack, shooting a gun in the office, starting a fire, etc. should've automatically gotten them arrested. "
DunderMifflin,"How did Dwight ever become manager? When Dwight became acting manager, even though he lost it for shooting a gun in the office, how did incidents like starting the fire not automatically disqualify him from becoming even acting manager? Furthermore, given the things David Wallace knew Dwight had done, why did he ever promote him to manager? "
DunderMifflin,"Why was Dwight originally just acting manager? When Dwight was made, ""acting manager,"" why wasn't he made an actual manager? "
DunderMifflin,did steve carole enable gym to be too mean to dwite? he was always prankin him all the time which is okay sometimes but in a real work place you would get wrote up one time and then the second time u get fired this one guy photoshoped another worker where i worked then there was a fist fight and the police were called so the boss fired them bothis steve carole to blame for dwite n gyms rivalry do you think they would have gotten along more if he set ground rules as a boss or do u think gym would have been firedif gym was fired for gift rapping dwites desk do u think pam and roy get married or does pam marry someone else like oscar???i think the office is a morale play and dwite was the victim in it all but they didnt have the guts to go all the way with it so the show devolved into andy bein the boss witch was bad tvplease discus

DunderMifflin,"Michael's Poor Dental Hygiene The show appears to establish that Michael has subpar oral health (references below) but I'm curious if there are any examples that I'm overlooking.

DunderMifflin,what's the deal with popcArn? I've seen the show as much or more than anyone and I don't hear any weird accent...  
DunderMifflin,After watching the Superfan episode of Dinner party I think Jan and Andy might have been perfect couple.
