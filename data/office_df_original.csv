Printer systems,"Good morning. 

I'm looking for a no-frills printer. I don't care about wireless or any of the new technology they bake into them to make them more expensive.

What Would You Do?,"Hello everyone!

First time posting here.
I wanted to describe this situation at my work, without dragging on too much.

I started as an admin assistant at an office and I was the only office staff amongst 4 providers, running the office while my boss was working in a different state. We started getting really busy with insurance and one of our other providers needed an assistant so my boss hired a medical assistant. She has more experience than me in regards to insurance and has knowledge in those things that I admit, I definitely had no knowledge of, and I have learned a lot from her. I trained her for our office and our policies and how to schedule, etc.

We have been working together for less than a month, trying to split the work and my boss sits me down and let‚Äôs me know that once she has the hours to give, she will be promoted to manager. 

That definitely upset me because I saw myself in that position in the near future. I definitely would‚Äôve preferred to not train my superior, especially not the role I‚Äôm interested in. I guess I‚Äôm mostly upset at how she went about it.",cherrydolewhip,10bkedf,1,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/10bkedf/what_would_you_do/,office,1673688418.0

Do you have any office-related wisdom to share with a young person unfamiliar with the culture?,"Hey guys,

I am a young 23M who last year through the right connections, was offered a part-time position in a small (6-7 people) office that manages events at a university. My role is roughly 75% in-person client ""babysitting"" and 25% administrative (Paperwork, excel, emails, etc.)

My boss is taking a leave of absence next month and I am being offered the chance to fill in for him while he's away. I come from retail and have never worked in an administrative role, nor do I have a relevant uni degree. I'll be in over my head and I know it, but I want to come into this temporary role as best I can. 

My question is, how do I function as one of these people? I've already had a hard time adapting to the ""Corporate speak"" that seems to be prevalent in email chains for God knows what reason. I want to ensure I hit the ground running and do the absolute best job I can so I can build my case for a promotion after my boss gets back.

Starting to resent coworker..,"I (F22) work as a customer service rep in a private airport base. I work with three other ladies, two are 50+ and the other is 20 and my friend outside of work. The coworker in question we‚Äôll call ‚ÄúLISA‚Äù. 

I want to begin by saying my managers close friend/ the offices accountant told my boss to not hire Lisa due to her terrible attitude and negative presence. This was before I got there. So already people don‚Äôt get along with her. So apparently when she got hired, it was known she had a job already but the agreement was she come at 10‚Ä¶


She has another job so she does 4-9am there and is supposed to be at work by 10. EVERYTIME she comes no sooner than 10:30. Even reaching wellll after 11. One time I had to pull a 12 hour shift because she came so late and blamed it on her other job.

When she comes in she always has Dunkin despite being late as hell. She doesn‚Äôt answer the phone unless I purposely don‚Äôt answer it because she waits for me to pick the calls up knowing I only let the phone ring once. Her work ethic sucks. She calls out last minute/comes late and doesn‚Äôt tell me knowing I‚Äôm going to be alone the whole shift. The job is light but the thing is I can‚Äôt eat, pee, look at my phone quick etc. I have to stay ears distance from the phones and incoming flights. She doesn‚Äôt say hi or greet anyone in the office and I sit at the counter with her. Literally me and her in the lobby together for four hours since I come in at 6-2. Everyone in the office knows not to even say hi to her cause either she won‚Äôt respond or will give a weird half butt hi like the person is bothering her by saying GM?? 

I even stopped taking initiative to speak so we won‚Äôt like at all. If I have to leave early I tell my boss and I leave and won‚Äôt say anything to her.

My boss brought me in the office two months after I began to tell me I need to stop being late 5-10 mins. And the same for my coworker. I understood that but allowing someone to come hours later with ZERO consequences in the same breath is crazy.",_777cherries,105ugxm,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/105ugxm/starting_to_resent_coworker/,office,1673112564.0

workplace worries,"I work in a big room with cubicles. Three different departments (it's relevant). My coworker in my department sits two spaces ahead of me so there's one cubicle between us. 
It's important to mention that I am neurodivergent. 
Lately she has taken to chewing ice. I get it, it has no calories and cuts down on munching on candy. But it's so loud I can't focus. Let alone the fact that a speaker is on the wall behind me, it's too much going on to make my brain focus. 
I've talked to my manager and she knows there's been beef between us two. I used to be across the aisle from ice lady but moved willingly due to the fact that she makes such random noises and narrates what she does. 
The music gets shut off 5 minutes before we leave. She was really chomping on her ice this afternoon. I basically ran to my car to have a panic attack. I can't stand to hear any kind of eating sounds.

my coworkers are dating and driving me insane,"Two people that work in my office that sit next to each other and me started dating and are incredibly loud and disruptive throughout the day and no one seems to care.

We work in an open office and they are always talking. When he comes in for the day, the first 30 minutes he's there they drink coffee and eat cookies and talk. They also live together so it's not like this is the only place they see each other. My management doesn't care, and if I ever bring up how distracting they are, I am looked at like a whiner.

They can be incredibly unprofessional, using profanity loudly while I'm working with customers at the front or while I'm on the phone, and they have an app that makes fart sounds that they think is hilarious. 

I've had issues with them in the past, they are very rude people who will make your life hell if they decide they don't like you,  and they use very ""mean girl"" tactics.

Should I change my workstation at office ?,"So, workstation allocation at my office is a bit of a free for all. You take whatever is free at the time. I'm in a shared cubicle where 4 employees can sit. Adequate spacing and all, no issues.

Basically, 4 of us sit there all the time so they are like our permanent places (unofficially).

I took leave a few weeks ago and when I got back another employee was sitting in my place. I was not offended or anything. I got my seat back & he/she moved to the seat next to mine since one of the other 3 was on leave. No biggie.

His/her normal seat is located quite far from our cubicle. Nevertheless, I did notice that he/she has a good rapport with the other 3 employees. This employee is new to the company by the way.

I'm thinking about exchanging my desk with him/her. That way he/she will get an opportunity to build the rapport. I got no issues with moving to his/her workstation. It will be far from my current desk, however I feel I will have less distractions so I think I will be able to focus on work better. His/her cubicle is exactly the same aa mine (design-wise).

How to create a happy workplace?,"&#x200B;

Did you know that 59% of the Indian workforce is unhappy with their workplace?

Let's look at the factors that contribute to this statistic. They include

* **Basic needs**\- In addition to salary, employees require support in terms of healthcare, insurance, etc. Employees tend to be unhappy or dissatisfied when such needs are unmet. 
* **Autonomy**\- Unhealthy power dynamics and exploitative relationships lead to unmotivated employees. 
* **Mastery**\- A work environment that does not provide the resources or environment for employees to learn and grow leads to a decline in motivation or interest to persist. 
* **Belonging**\- Lack of community or comradery within the workplace can make employees feel disconnected and lead to increased absenteeism. 

Now you may have heard about the workplace culture at companies like Google and Microsoft. They are known to create a safe, comfortable, and engaging environment for their employees. There are various benefits associated with a happy workplace. For instance, happy employees are great assets to the company as it leads to improvement in productivity, professionalism, and commitment. Further, the workplace motivates employees to go above and beyond as they perceive the organization's success as their own. Finally, there is a sense of belongingness and a strong community that forms as a result of a cooperative and safe workplace.",cadabamsgroup,zyvkog,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/zyvkog/how_to_create_a_happy_workplace/,office,1672389821.0
How to deal with a micromanager,"I've been at my new job for three months now. My last place of employment pretty much handed out task & trusted their employees to get it done with very little interference. This place, not so much. I get asked the usual ""Hey, how's it going"" quite frequently through out the day. I figured maybe it is because I am new & they're making sure I am getting adjusted. 

There is one coworker in particular who feels the need to hover over me whenever she hands me a project. She acts as if we don't know how to do our job. She's at my desk every 20 minutes. She sits behind me but she's constantly turning around to ask me Captin Obvious questions. I'm suprised 
her neck isn't hurting from looking over her shoulders all day. If I look through my purse, she turns around. My phone vibrates, she turns around. I rattle a plastic take out bag, she turns around. Then she complains she can never finish HER work. Here's an idea. Try minding your own computer screen for a while, hush for a few hours, trust your coworkers to handle their part & you just might get some work done. Ya just might. 

She's not my manager or supervisor. She wasn't even introduced to me during my interview. To make matters worse, she tries to give me useless tips on how to use the program to go about doing my job. She doesn't even know how to use the program effectively herself. She often asks me for help troubleshooting. She doesn't even have the technological know how to update old out dated software. We told her to update but she scoffed at us as if that's not the problem. She calls herself helping at times but she ruins the files by using the out dated system. A small tasks takes longer now thanks to her. I keep copies on my desktop just in case she opens & corrupts something. I design things on the computer btw. Its annoying to interrupt mid way through designing to tell the person how to go about making it. Its a creative process. Its like asking a baker to see the cake decoration while he's blending the cake batter. She is the type to tell him what blender to use instead & what temperature to set the oven. 

The only way to keep her from constantly being over my shoulder is to say ""I'm working on it. I'll let you know when it is done"". I have to repeat the magic words a few times before she temporarily disappears. Sometimes I wear headphones as a hint to DND but it doesn't work. She'll find a book or a peice of paper just to get up from her desk & be disruptive. Plus I also wear headphones because these people listen to the same playlist of golden oldies from the 1960s everyday for the three months I've been there. The introvert in me is going mad. I find myself hanging out in the bathroom just to get away & to calm my nerves before I blow up on her. I've had some irritating coworkers before but this is the WORST I've ever encountered. From browsing the company's server, my position has a high turn over rate. Gee..wonder why. 

My friends & family suggest I talk to the superior in our department. Someone suggested I ask to move my seat. I would LOVE to but the office is small & all the work stations are taken. I may document the times she is at my desk just so it won't seem like I'm ranting to just to rant. I am going to start job hunting but in the meantime time, what can be done to keep this annoying person from being an over bearing micromanager.",Blue8191,zykggl,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/zykggl/how_to_deal_with_a_micromanager/,office,1672357353.0
Bathroom Disrespect,"How do I subtly/nicely/passively tell a coworker to clean up after herself?

I have a coworker that leaves behind horrible messes in the bathroom. The messes are so gross, that many people walk three flights of stairs to use another restroom when they encounter the messes. With a fear of being too graphic, she ""slimes"" the toilet seat and leaves behind long pubic hairs. I will never fault anyone for the smell they leave behind in a bathroom because that cannot be controlled; however, we have bathroom spray available and she does not use it. Lastly, and this is another thing you cannot really control, she leaves huge smears in the bowl which could be addressed by double flushing. Mostly and mainly- the body fluid and hair on the toilet seat are what bothers me the most. 

Most times I wipe the seat off with a clorox wipe when I encounter the mess, but I really feel like I shouldn't have to. Isn't it common courtesy to clean up after yourself? Yesterday the mess was so gross, that I just walked three flights of stairs to use another bathroom. People do that often around this building. 

Our workplace has 6 women and a really nice, clean restroom. It's a single bathroom, so you're able to lock the door and have privacy. It's so blatantly obvious who is leaving the mess, but everyone just sort of deals with it or talks about the issue behind this woman's back. No one has ever confronted her about it. 

I'm at a loss of what to do. I don't want to post a passive aggressive note in the bathroom, but confronting this person would be so uncomfortable given the subject matter.

Smelly coworker,"Ever since winter started, one particular coworker who sits behind me started coming to work with a very strong smell. I‚Äôve even did a little experiment; it seems that on Mondays and halfway through Tuesdays, he will smell relatively normal, but as the days go on, the smell increases to the point that it literally smells like cat poop by Friday. On Fridays, my productivity level is the lowest because I simply cannot focus anymore. My hypothesis is that due to the cold, he only bathes on the weekend.

My other desk neighbors all suffer as I do but none of us actually say it out loud. We just put diffuser perfumes on our desks and exchange glances to each other when the smell becomes significantly strong. I feel like I get the worse of it though since I am directly in the way of the ventilation flow which passes by him first before going through me. Also, unlike my other colleagues, my work requires me to sit longer in my desk while the others have more onfield jobs. 

I am the only girl in this area of the office though, and am also not that close to any of my coworkers so I don‚Äôt feel comfortable bringing this up to the other guys. This particular smelly coworker is also quite isolated from the others due to him being a foreigner (I‚Äôm also a foreigner but I‚Äôve been here longer).

My Supervisor Smells,"Good afternoon, I haven't been at my office job long, just under a year. I am actually really struggling in more areas then one. But my biggest issue is my supervisor who started after me. She smokes heavily, and she sits across from me, I have spoken to her/my boss and I was allowed to purchase a wax melter at an attempt to help with the smell. It helps but not nearly enough, it is to the point I smell it constantly but it is most strongly in the office when she is here. I have always been sensitive to cigarette odors but I think with the colder weather in our area she has started smoking in her car making the issue that much worse. I get a head ache and feel incredible sick when I am in the office and it affects my ability to focus. I am not sure how to get this resolved with no ones feelings getting hurt but it is to the point I do not want to come in.

I smoke weed in my off time, but I do so in different clothes and not on my breaks or before work and I have always tried to make an effort not to smell when I go out in public and I rarely if ever smoke in my car, I don't want my car to smell. I am having to take shorter breaths and it is just awful. I don't want anyone to think I am being fussy because of it but the smell makes me feel so ill. I know smokers don't realize they smell like they do so I am not sure if I should reach out to our boss again or contact HR.",NewNavySpouse,zm0pc8,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/zm0pc8/my_supervisor_smells/,office,1671048198.0

So I joined this new organisation 4 months back and I have been working my ass off. Im in an IT firm and there have many critical activities that I took part in and helped them save time. All my colleagues appreciate my  skills and effort also mostly at times I help them get over with any technical hurdles they face or need assistance even though Im not liable to. I have been very dedicated since day 1

So recently my appraisal cycle opened up, and my manager during my review told me that I‚Äôm not visible. Like wtf bro?! Everybody knows what my contribution has been since these past 4 months! And then goes on saying you need send more mails if you work and all that shit. Fr though, when I told my colleagues this they laughed like thats not possible even I did for a min when he said it to my face. Our team inboxes are filled with my name.  My manager didn‚Äôt even appreciate for the efforts I put in and saved his ass from serious escalations.

Colleague asked me to take meeting notes AFTER the meeting,"I'm wondering if this is something that's normal, and just never happened in my old role, or if this is a weird request. I also want to make clear that I'm not complaining, I'm definitely showing my inexperience!  I just want to know if this is usual practice! 

We had a team meeting yesterday to talk about strategy. It was a productive meeting, but I noticed that one of the PIs wasn't taking notes. In my old role (and I'll admit it's the only office job I've had before this one. I was there for 4 years), whoever was taking notes would be asked to do so before the meeting started, so they knew to take notes in a way that's able to be shared later with the team. I wasn't asked, and given that it was an internal, fairly routine meeting with everyone present, I just took notes for myself, like I usually would. Then, about an hour after the meeting, the PI, who hadn't taken any notes, emailed me to ask if I could share my notes with him so he can distribute them to the other project teams. 

I'm happy to do this, but I want to ask him if he'll let me know before meetings if he wants me to take notes, so I can take better ones.

"People who message you on Teams at work but just put ""Hi [Name]"" and then wait for you to respond","So I'm pretty busy at work and I sometimes get a Teams message from people I may not know about something they think I might know the answer to. 

Anyone else annoyed when colleagues just send a message saying ""Hi [Name]"" and then don't actually write anything more?  Like you've just interrupted me and now you're not going to say anything else?  I know they're probably waiting for me to say ""hi"" back but I just want them to get on with telling me what they want.

I know it's petty but it's even got to the point where I don't even respond unless they send a message with what they want from me.  It's bad enough when they send a message with just ""Hi [Name]"" and then send the next message separately but when they send a ""hi"" and the wait for me to respond before they get into what they want.  Quit wasting my time and get to the point.

It might be a lot to read in one go but when I send a message I will put the hello in the same message I ask for what I want (like I'd do in an email), mostly so I don't have to wait for them to respond to then keep writing but also so it's just done straightaway and they can respond when they want to but at least know straightaway what I want and aren't waiting for me to come back if they respond and I've gone away because then I'm just irritated wondering why they couldn't have just asked me a question outright off the bat.

Light related Sick Building Syndrome,"Hi guys. Many of you took part in my survey last week and I got some fantastic responses back so thank you to everyone who took part. I have come up with some product solutions based on the feedback I received which I wanted to share with you. I have put together a very short survey that will take 2 minutes to complete to get some feedback on some designs. Whether or not you took part in the first study, feel free to take part in this one. It's open to anyone from any country.

**Survey Link for product ideas**

 [https://bournemouth.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/concept-preferences](https://bournemouth.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/concept-preferences) 

To give a brief explanation on the product I'm designing, I want to design a product for an individual's workspace that you set up at your desk space to block out fluorescent light. Adding a softer sunlight mimicking lamp into the product to illuminate the user's workspace could be beneficial to replace the light that's being block out but I'm open to other suggestions. 

Images of the designs are included in the survey.

For those of you who haven't seen my study, to summarise I'm a product design student researching sick building syndrome caused by light. The research looks to target anyone who experiences the following symptoms at work:

Fatigue

Eyestrain

Low mood

Headaches

Space Heater in Small office Setting,"I work in an office with 4 other ladies... We have no windows so it gets stuffy in our office as is. We have one co-worker who will run her space heater no matter the time of year. It can be  100 degrees out and she will have it on. It drives me absolutely insane. I find that it is inconsiderate to the rest of the office. I personally have voiced my opinion mainly because I have asthma, so when I get hot, it will trigger an attack. I have heard others voice their opinions. Other employees from various departments always comment on how hot our office is and she does NOTHING about it. She just does not care. 

What is the best course of action? I have thought about trying to break the heater but she will just go get another one. There has to be some sort of compromise.",AlltheCrayz,yv9g75,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/yv9g75/space_heater_in_small_office_setting/,office,1668453262.0

I can't stop crossing my leg over my knee when sitting at a desk with heels on HELP,"  

I just started working in an office after doing school from home for 3 years. Now that I have to dress up for work, I do wear heels a lot to the office. However, when I wear them I've notice that it's instinct to cross my right leg over my left knee and I cannot find another comfortable position no matter how hard I try. I constantly get pain shooting down my spine when sit like this with heels on. I've gotten an ergonomic chair, adjusted my monitors, and even have gotten a foot stand but nothing feels comfortable and my back continues to hurt. I know I could just take my heels off, but I don't like my feet being cold and like to have them on just in case I need to get up and walk to someone else's office really quickly. All of that rambling to say that I need any advice I can on the following questions‚Äî

1) Does anyone have any suggestions on how to sit with heels on at a desk without crossing my leg over my knee? 

2) How can I adjust the lumbar and height of my chair to prevent this mid-upper back pain? I'm 5'7 and have a long torso, so the arch in my back is a bit higher than average. 

3) Any tips on how to not adjust your chair 1000 times a day and never finding a position that is comfortable??

SUPERIOR THAT IS DISRESPECTFUL,"I have a huge dilema in my office. Turns out that another coworker (who has a higher position) is very disrespectful towards other employees, specially if they are young women. 

His acts of disrespect include: making fun of your mistakes even if its with clients, blame others for his mistakes, making fun of coworkers,negatively talking about other coworkers performance,and even while presenting, he looks for any opportunity to embarrass you in-front of others.

Even though a lot of employees had complained to HR about this person before, no one does anything about it because he brings most of the clients to the company

These symptoms are alleviated once the person leaves work. I'm specifically looking into how light affects people in the work place and ultimately, I aim to design a product that can alleviate symptoms of SBS and make the workplace a much more comfortable environment for the user.

It would be amazing if any of you who suffer from this (no diagnosis required, you just experience one or more symptoms) could fill out this short survey for my dissertation. Thank you guys :)

Looking to buy a Kyocera KM 4035 Photocopier,"Hey there I‚Äôm pretty new to the world of photocopiers so I was hoping to get some insight on whether this is a purchase to pass on or one worth consideration.

I found somebody selling a used Kyocera KM 4035 Photocopier and a DF71 Document Finisher for $100. It seems like a great price. so I asked if it was in good working order and what the number of total copies was on the machine. 

They said it was in good working condition and that the DF71 punches, staples and sorts. It also acts as a de facto office mailbox system too (for faxes coming through would be my guess.)

They said the total number of copies made was 1,120,693. With the drum life being 500,000 and rated for use of up to 85,000 copies monthly. 

I figure at $100 it may not have a significant amount of life left.. but the price is fairly low. 

It was under a service contract until they closed their business and it‚Äôs not in use except to test it recently to determine that it is still working and to prepare it to sell.

Based on what info I‚Äôve got and provided here. What are peoples thoughts? Is this a worthwhile purchase? Better to try find a used copier with less total copies on it?

The purpose for this would be primarily for printing zines (yeah, old school style zines), graphic design and editorial layout projects.
So probably relatively low volume to medium volume. Well below the 85,000/monthly copies the photocopier is apparently rated for.

How to ask my coworker to turn off the space heater? It makes it so hot I start to sweat.,"So the whole story is that my office used to be pretty cold. I found it comfortable, many found it too icy. So, after hearing my coworkers whine about it, I suggested they try a space heater. It solved their problem.

...but now I'm *hot*. My coworker knows this because I've mentioned it several times, and I talked to her about it, and asked if we could compromise on a heated blanket or something. She was open to it, I bought her the best heated blanket I could find, she said she loved it...and she doesn't use it. Something about getting skeeved out when it touches the floor. And I literally cannot dress any lighter than I do under the dress code.

&#x200B;

It's upsetting because *I looked out for them*, but now that the ""solution"" is uncomfortable for me, they don't seem to care. They come to the office in relatively light clothing, heavier clothes aren't worn anymore, they just use the heater, but I can't get away from it and there are no ""mini AC"" units (because thermodynamics).

Undermining colleague,"Hey everyone,

How would you recommend going about an undermining colleague to your manager? For context, I work in insurance underwriting, I‚Äôve been in the job 7 months and the colleague in question for nearly a year.

For those who have no experience in underwriting, there is quite a lot to keep up to date with and certain information that you shouldn‚Äôt mention but it‚Äôs still a learning curve for myself - need to make some mistakes to learn is my view!

Anyway this afternoon I was on a call with a broker and as soon as the call finished my colleague said straight away ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt have said that, they might kick up a fuss now‚Äù. I replied that I‚Äôve said it now and I can‚Äôt do anything about it. They then basically said ‚Äúfor fucks sake‚Äù.

Do you have to move soon? You must be fretting over the relocation process.

Undoubtedly, moving is overall a tough process that demands effort, time, and planning. If you're moving a home or an office, it can be troublesome to move all the valuables in one piece. And, if you are moving across state lines, it'll be even more challenging. Moreover, the physical and emotional stress can be extremely exhaustive and can jeopardize your entire moving process. Thus, hiring professionals to move your valuables is the best way to deal with it.

In this blog piece, we are going to talk about the 5 main benefits of hiring a professional team of packers and movers for a stress-free moving experience.

## 5 Benefits of Hiring Packers and Movers for Your Next Big Move

Moving and packing can be tiring, but hiring a professional for the same can save you a lot of trouble. Apart from a seamless moving experience, there are numerous advantages of hiring professional and experienced moving firms when relocating to a new location or city.

Let‚Äôs take a quick glance at the 5 most notable benefits of hiring [professional moving services](https://bydesignofficemovers.com/)

**1. Efficient and Well-Planned Moving**: There is a wide array of benefits of hiring packers and movers. No doubt, moving is difficult but people often mistake packing for an easy task. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Only the packing itself takes days, even weeks to complete and is physically exhaustive. You will have to pack and move your furniture, appliances, personal belongings, decorative items, and other valuables. Ensuring the protection of everything during the hectic can be chaotic for you. Enter the professional packers and movers service providers. They utilize appropriate padding and soft wrapping material for packing. Moreover, they efficiently pack the items to store more items in the minimum possible space.

In addition, they pay extra attention to fragile belongings and carefully pack and carry them from one location to another. Once the belongings are transferred to the destination, the expert team will assist with unloading and unpacking the items as well. All in all, everything is taken care of and you don‚Äôt have to even lift your finger. Moreover, you won‚Äôt have to hire any extra help as everything is taken care of.

**2. Hassle-Free Moving**: Moving to a new place might disrupt your regular routine. To avoid disrupting your routine, hire a packer and mover. When you unload your physical stress on professional packers and movers, the emotional stress unloads as well. Moreover, packing and moving can potentially take days or even weeks. Instead of wasting all this time packing and transferring your belongings, you can be productive in your daily routine. Relocating to the same city is pretty easy as all you need to do is spend a couple of hours overseeing the transition process.

Once you hire professionals, you can sit back and relax. Whether inside your city or outside the city move, be assured of the protected transition of your possessions. All you have to do is give a date to the service providers you hired to ensure you have time to have your new house ready before the truck arrives.

**3. Cost-Effective**: When you compare the expenses of moving yourself against hiring a packer and mover, you'll find that hiring a packer and mover service is less expensive. Firstly, you'll be spending a lot of time alone packing all of your belongings, Secondly, you will be missing work. Thirdly, if anything goes wrong, you can end up breaking or losing your valuables. Thus, hiring professional movers and packers is not only convenient but is also pocket-friendly. They put a higher emphasis on the safety of the contents and making the entire process seamless.

**4. Best-in-industry, Professional Movers**: There is no one better for the job than an experienced moving company when it comes to packing and moving. Their years of experience make them proficient in enabling a smooth transition experience. Moreover, they are used to doing heavy lifting. Thus, moving furniture up and down the stairs is not a difficult task for professionals. To avoid injuries, you may conjure while doing the heavy lifting hire experienced movers that have all of the essential equipment to transport heavy goods.

**5. Insurance Coverage**: Most transit firms offer insurance to ensure the protection of your valuables. It means if any of your valuable possessions get damaged during packing and moving, you can claim compensation. Moreover, professional firms settle claims within a few days if there is any accidental damage. Accidents happen all the time, but knowing that your belongings are safe will offer you a sense of security.

You can't go wrong with all of the advantages of hiring a professional moving company. Make sure you make a rational decision to hire professional movers when planning your next move. Whether it's across the country or across the state, hiring professionals is always a wise decision!",bydesignofficemover,xq3v6b,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/xq3v6b/top_5_benefits_of_hiring_moving_services/,office,1664342937.0

How to handle office slander,"I am 6 months old on a job as a junior, working as an external with a big corporation (going to become internal next year). I have made some initial minor mistakes on the job, learned from them, and gave better results to my team over time. However, a person on the team (who is an internal, 4 years in the corporation; also new to the team but comes from a different department and less productive than me; always going on holiday) is recounting my past mistakes to the other teams I work with directly to get my work done, and now they think that I am inherently incompetent, even if I am doing my best to facilitate the team's work. The person in question has only verbally gossiped about me and made me look bad in front of others and now they feel unsure about the efforts that I put in. Meanwhile, this person is also spreading misinformation within my team, telling people that the other team (who I just mentioned) is unhappy with the work that I put in. When I confronted the other team about this, they confirmed that they don't have any formal complaints against me, only some minor points of improvement and 1 of them even told me that they can see that I am trying to do my best. At this point, I am considering approaching my team manager and disclosing this dynamic, as it could put the team's productivity at risk (as my work relationships are getting jeopardized). I don't have concrete proof (as all this happened verbally between the person and the question and the teams). Even if the team manager denies my credibility about the situation, I feel like he should know the team's work and productivity are under threat because of this dynamic and person. I only have one trusted source about the gossip, who is also a junior, and I am afraid that he would refuse to go on the record for me. So I am really all by myself in all of this... My biggest concern is that I will be seen as a newcomer troublemaker as I don't have concrete proof, and no one by my side to testify for me, and eventually get fired to protect the person in question who is internal.",Zakinanders,xhrxwq,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/xhrxwq/how_to_handle_office_slander/,office,1663534827.0
Help on restoring MS Word file,"So I was working on a research paper, on word using my MacBook air m1. Due to the nature of this device, I rarely shut it down, only close the lid.
Autosave was on, and the file was on a OneDrive synced folder.

Today when I was done with the bibliography of my work, I tried to save the document to the onedrive folder where it has been sitting for over 3 weeks. Upon pressing the save button, an error about saving failed because of insufficient memory appeared. After that, word closed and reopened and offered to restore from a recovered file. I agreed, and to my despair, it restored to an old backup, around 1 week old, loosing almost 100 hours of work in one swift move. The newly restored file has no version history and it's autosave feature is toggled off.
Only then I became aware the onedrive app had crashed days ago without giving notice. When I opened the OneDrive app again, my account wasn't even on it, and it prompted to enter my user credentials again.

So far, I tried:
-Restoring previous version from word itself; the option is greyed out in the menu
-Looking inside automatic recovery folder; first, it was different than the folder location indicated in several tutorials, and secondly, it sits completely empty, even when toggling the view for hidden items.
-Accesing MacOS TMP folder; no luck finding the file there.
-Restoring from Time Machine; I hadn't activated it on this Mac.

Can being a top-performer cost me a promotion?,"So I have been interviewing for a new position at the company I work for. It is open for both internal and external applicants, and I am the only internal candidate. I was encouraged by my direct supervisor to apply because he thinks I'm being underused.

After 3 interviews with different departments and 1 written task, I have one interview left with the head of my department. The thing is, I've heard from other people that he is hesitant to promote me because I am the top performer of my current team and if I moved to another position that could hurt the KPIs and leave a huge gap. I know for a fact that the rest of the managers believe in me and have provided the best feedback for my skills and work ethic.

Do you have any ideas about how I can convince him? Have you had similar experiences? So far my main argument is that any external candidate would need a long time to familize themselves with the company's product and procedures, and that could potentially push back the desired results. But what if he's willing to sacrifice the position's objectives for some time if he views my contribution to my current team as more valuable?

I would hate to miss out on an opportunity for a position I'm really excited about just because the big boss is scared that the rest of the team's performance will go down the drain without me",NovaCPH,xcomdh,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/xcomdh/can_being_a_topperformer_cost_me_a_promotion/,office,1663017784.0

Was I wrong to ask my coworker not to talk about politics at work?,"I work from home now at the same place but this happened back in 2020 when I used to work full time in the office. Not to start a political debate here, but I have a coworker that's in her 60s, she's a huge Trump supporter and MAGA republican and she thinks Covid is a conspiracy. For a long time, our office was short staffed and my boss had to be gone for long stretches of time so there would be many days that I would be alone in the office with this coworker. During these times, she would go off on political rants. I didn't engage by expressing my opinions because I didn't want the work relationship to go sour. This person has been nice to me, I just don't agree with her politics. I listened to her rants for weeks if not months until it got to a point that it made me extremely angry. I work at a very small company so I asked my boss if she could meet with me and I explained what was going on. Myself and another coworker asked my boss if she could just ask everyone in the company in general to stop discussing these things at work, but she didn't. She said the company was too small for that and she made me confront my coworker about it directly. All I told her was that it just got too intense and I didn't want to talk about politics at work. She apologized and I thought we were fine after that. Well, I just heard from another coworker that she frequently makes comments like ""Well, I'm not allowed to talk about politics because OP doesn't like it."" I was honestly shocked by this. She makes it sound like I was being overly sensitive or something when really I just didn't want to hear it anymore. I try to stick with the policy of not talking about sex, politics, or religion at work. Was I in the wrong to say something? Should I have just sucked it up?

Pulled in to the office.,"So I've been working here for 4 days. There is a picture of the original team on the hallway of the office. I asked who one of the people closest to the owner was since I didn't recognize him. The person told me his name and that he had been let go. Someone overheard that and told the boss. Things were a bit odd by day 3. 4 people disappeared. One of those people was training me so I asked if it was their day off. On day 4 i find out all those people got fired. Then I get called in and the boss says ""I hear you have some questions about Tim, the guy in the picture. I'm all about transparency, I want to know what you've heard and I want to answer any questions you may have about to."" I told him I didn't know anything about the guy since I just started but I asked about the picture and just asked who he was nothing more. He responded with ""is that really all you know. We are all about transparency so just tell me everything you've heard about Tim. We parted ways because he wasn't a right fit and that was that. Does that answer your questions about the matter?"" I said ""I just about the picture is all and the one that was training me since I thought he would still be training me. I thought if was his day off and now I see he's no longer here, so I was just curious since no one seemed to know where he was at the time. That's all."" To which he responded with ""ok so do you have anymore questions. In the future feel free to ask me any questions. I'll answer any questions."" So that's my fourth day working in an office for the first time.  Sheesh. From what I later learned. All the four people that were let go, including the guy training me, were all connected to Tim in some way. Apparently they were all trialed by him and from what the boss said, they learned bad habits from him. Idk this is really odd and I am going to just stick it out for a few months with this target on my back because I feel like I am not in the scopes view waiting for me to mess up and give them an excuse to get rid of me.

Office n.1 did not provide excessively junky stuff, it was usually very plain crackers, some cookies, just to get over the munchies. I never saw anybody take advantage of it, like going grocery-shopping in the office pantry... 
They would also offer drinks and appetizers on Friday after 5:00pm. I thought the snacks were pretty useful and having drinks with the bosses on Friday was a bonding moment (it was a short business, not an excuse to keep you in the office longer).

"""Your coworkers need to know you're working""","Is it normal for a workplace to have an open for all to see spreadsheet of productivity?

We have a spreadsheet (which is largely self reported) that keeps track of what everyone's doing. Projects, savings, queue work, phone calls... everything.

I'm used to some form of productivity report existing, but in the past productivity was between the employee and the manager.

Ever since I started at this place, at my reviews, I've been chewed out for not projecting well enough FOR MY COWORKERS that I'm doing work.

I need to speak up at the weekly meetings and give updates so my coworkers know I'm doing work.

I dropped 1 goal category for a couple of days to focus on another goal category (which I projected would bring us in a lot of savings).... I got told off for not holding to the other numbers. Again ""Everyone needs to see you're working on this""

The damn spreadsheet is largely self reported, and I'm more focused on getting things done than on updating it. My boss knows what projects I'm working on... he either gives them to me or I update him constantly... oh but I'm leaving a bad impression on our department head and my coworkers because what I'm doing isn't reflecting on the board.

Is this normal?!

Honestly... I can work... or I can keep up some sort of appearance, not both. And the stress of ""OMG Am I doing enough? Am I doing the right thing this week? Everyone is looking at me! What if this project doesn't tic the right box!!"" is really getting to me.

It's the only complaint I've gotten the whole time I've worked here... and year in and year out I'm told my coworkers are going to think I'm being lazy.

Or that they already think I'm being lazy.

It's like it doesn't actually matter what I've done... because it wasn't quantified on the board in the right place at the right time it didn't matter.

.... so again... is it normal to be able to see virtually real-time numbers of what everyone's doing at any given time? Is part of office work constantly making sure your coworkers KNOW FOR CERTAIN you're pulling your weight?

I did the program for a year and a half and I got a official offer in Analytics department. Our departments have several teams. I really liked the team I worked for as a graduate so wanted to join that team but they didn‚Äôt have enough head-count so I joined different team. 

Soon I found out I didn‚Äôt really enjoy the job I did there and applied for new role in different team (same department), got the job and started working in new team only 6 months after I joined that previous team. I knew this was a bad look so I am trying to stay at least a year in this team. 
But my pay became a little annoying problem. 

I found out that I was getting paid 3000 dollar less in my previous team comparing to Graduates who joined a year later than I did. That contributed to my team change and I managed to negotiate and bumped it up to reduce the gap to roughly 2000 now. 

I am waiting for performance review result and since I only joined the team 4months prior to the performance review so I am expecting moderate grade. This will eventually mean I would get paid roughly 5000 dollar less than graduates who joined a year later. Because of pay band, graduates who joined 2 years earlier and found the right team early, would already be getting paid 2000 more than I am now. 

This will eventually mean, I will be bottom of the pay band for another year, even though I worked in same department for almost 2 years (including graduate period). This really demotivates me and makes me want to move job. I understand I am new to the team so I worked extra hard, get comments that I don‚Äôt look like I am new. Seniors in my team ask me for advice for some of the things they do and I can explain comfortably which surprises me too sometimes. But still treated as if I am working as bottom of the pay band?

I discussed it with my manager and got told it is what it is. Focus on self development and you will get there. 2000-5000 per year is nothing once taxed. I personally think it is matter of respect but was not negotiable. 

I am writing CV just in case I find something new but would this be a bad decision and look bad on my cv. I like the team and I like the work I do but money is just very demotivating. Money is not everything but it is something to me. But just to keep the resume nice, should I stay another year and move? It will be my 2nd year me getting under paid. I am not sure if I can mentally handle it unless it is for something.",Refrigerator95,wsdexz,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/wsdexz/is_it_really_that_bad_if_i_move_job_or_team_too/,office,1660913971.0
Looking for a used/new chair. Budget 400 USD. I live in EU. Never Sat on chairs listed below.,"Hello everyone. I'm looking for a chair, mostly used ones, but there's also some new ones.

As said above, I'm looking for a chair, I've done some research, what is good and what is recommended, but I'm not sure which one (from the good chairs) should I pick in particular. So, I live in the EU, so I don't have the opportunity to get insanely deals like Steelcase Leap v2 for 80 USD.

Before I list the choices I have, it's worth mentioning that I never sat on any on those, so I have no idea which one would suit me the best (also, I don't have the opportunity to try any of them (yeah, I live in the country, here basically it's impossible to find 'high end' chairs locally)). I'm 178cm (5.8) and weigh about 60kg (132 lbs). 

So without further ado there are the choices I have:

Used:

Steelcase Leap V1 - 278 USD

Steelcase Amia - 220 USD

Haworth Comforto X89 Zody - 147 USD

Herman Miller Sayl - 308 USD

Humanscale Freedom - 439 USD

Herman Miller Mirra - 411 USD

Secretlab Omega - 325 USD

Grospol Ioo WS KMD31 - 216 USD

Autonomous Ergochair 2 - 325 USD

New:

IKEA J√§rvfj√§llet - 195 USD

Unique Wau 2 - 454 USD

These are decent options that I found. My maximum budget is 400 USD, but I can add some more if it'll be significantly better choice. I have never sat on any of those and my daily chair till now is an Akracing Player.

Yeah, speaking of the Akracing one, do you think it's even worth it for me to buy a new chair, instead of just keeping using it?

I extremely appreciate every comment and every response. Anyway, I wish you a wonderful day and have a great one <3",lilkasui,wr488l,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/wr488l/looking_for_a_usednew_chair_budget_400_usd_i_live/,office,1660780773.0

Need some input on the best programs to use.,"Okay I don‚Äôt know if this is the right sub but I need some ideas/help on how to get this done, and am hoping maybe someone in here has been in a similar situation.

So my company does not have a training program for new hires whatsoever, there is an extremely old ‚ÄúOperations bible‚Äù from 2014, which is like 2000 pages long, outdated and extremely not cool to drop on a new persons lap and basically wish them the best of luck.


Being one of the senior employees, part of my duties includes training new people. I work in computer operations, and a lot of the things we do, there is no way anyone outside the company would have any knowledge of, so it‚Äôs not really skills you can google or YouTube. So training, Which as of right now, is literally learn as we go. 

So bc I‚Äôve been tasked with training, I want to make something kind of like a digital training binder, and am unsure what program would be the best to use.

This is what I need it to do

Digital Employe Training Manual

-digital binder style with clickable tabs


-need to be able to hyper link procedures


-would like to be able to make links to websites used


- need to be able to link to documents/ folders on our network.


-need to be able to edit the ‚Äúbinder‚Äù to be able to update procedures if/when new ones come in


-need it PW protected so only me/ management can edit what‚Äôs in the binder



We do have procedures already written, but it is the equivalence of having a 14 page document on a 5 step situation written in legalese more or less. And are only really helpful if you already know what your doing/ maybe just haven‚Äôt done said procedure in a while. 


I‚Äôm going to be linking the original procedures for reference, but essentially creating an easy to follow ‚Äúquick guide‚Äù on the procedures we have. 

This cannot be browser based, and it has to be free or a one time forever payment type deal that doesn‚Äôt cost too much( I‚Äôm doing this on my own accord to make MY life easier, since we seem to have high turnover, and I‚Äôm the one stuck doing the training. so the company isn‚Äôt going to pay anything for it) 

I have Canva pro so I can make little graphics where I need them.

And I have access to Microsoft suite so excel, PowerPoint, word, access, ect

I would like to be able to make quick guides, with position tasks, checklist, times we do certain tasks, ect so like a training manual 

If possible I also want to be able to make training videos/ audio to go with visuals (not 100%) a requirement.

If I have to use separate programs to make the ‚Äúmanual‚Äù and the training videos so be it, or if I have to DL a program that‚Äôs fine too but I‚Äôm having trouble getting started just figuring out what program this would be best to start in.

‚óè  A lack of lower-lumbar comfort from your workplace chair might create lower back discomfort.

‚óè  Another complication of poor posture is the development of carpal tunnel syndrome, which occurs when the wrist is flexed at an angle rather than straight.

Office Generation Gap?,"I‚Äôm Gen X and work with a lot of younger people. Mostly millennials? Maybe whatever the generation behind? I don‚Äôt know exactly, but a lot of them are in their 20s in their first professional jobs post-college. 

Anyway, these folks are mostly great, but several of them have big emotional responses to normal office-place annoyances. I‚Äôm talking having to take up the slack for someone who‚Äôs out sick or having to do tasks that are actually part of their job that they just don‚Äôt like. I mean, this is normal crap that any working person has to deal with on a regular basis, but they react as if some major labor law has been violated. 

Anyone have any insight into what the hell this is about? It‚Äôs like their personal feelings are THE most important thing and MUST be expressed. Injustice is everywhere and they are the persecuted. It‚Äôs exhausting. I mean, this is the job you applied for. It‚Äôs a decent job with flexibility, benefits, generous PTO, and reasonable pay. It‚Äôs not the world‚Äôs greatest job, but far from the worst. Definitely a great first job for someone with no work experience. 

They also seem to feed off one another. It‚Äôs almost like a protest mentality, fighting against ‚Äúthe man.‚Äù Disgruntled is probably the best way to describe it. General vibe is that they‚Äôre better than this place and this job and they want to be sure everyone knows. 

Personally, I don‚Äôt care how they feel. I‚Äôd just like them to either shut up and do the work or go get another job and let the rest of us work in peace. It‚Äôs draining. I do my best to avoid the worst of them, but it‚Äôs not always easy. I like my job, but I‚Äôm starting to look around.

I don‚Äôt know if this is a generational thing or if it‚Äôs just one or two rotten apples poisoning the lot. The only commonality is age. Like I said, it‚Äôs not all of the younger staff, but the ‚Äúloudly disgruntled‚Äù are exclusively the younger set. A coworker suggested it‚Äôs a generational thing. Have others experienced similar?

Potential workplace stalker,"Hey guys.

I am a 32 y/o female and I work in a real estate office in the marketing department. The door to the marketing office cannot ever be closed as the air conditioner system is dependent on that door staying open.

About two months ago, someone stole my work laptop from my desk, along with a brokerage-branded pillow and hat. My coworker‚Äôs laptop, which was in the same office that we share, was left untouched. Both of our laptops were clearly visible, along with her iPad and personal laptop. I filed a police report and chalked it up to an agent unfortunately seizing the opportunity to gain a new laptop. This cannot be attributed to housekeeping, as it was taken on a Tuesday and they only come M-W-F.

A few weeks later, the recycling bin that my coworkers contribute to (I turn it in and add the money to my savings account) was emptied. Again, this was done on a Thursday when housekeeping wasn‚Äôt here. I chalked this up to someone needing the money more than me, and silently wished them well.

When I left the office yesterday, I looked at my full water bottle and though, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt drink enough water,‚Äù and closed the lid so that it didn‚Äôt get accidentally knocked over and spilled on my computer.
When I came in this morning, my trusty water bottle was waiting on my desk for me, perfectly empty and with the lid off. Following the pattern, my coworkers belongings were untouched.
In my four years here, housekeeping has never done anything like that. They are only contracted to take out the trash and vacuum.

Agents and staff alike can access the office at any time of the day by entering a code in the door keypad that is specific to them. Unfortunately, my company doesn‚Äôt pay extra for the service that records who used their code and when.

Has anyone ever dealt with something like this? Do you have any advice for me? I‚Äôm going to try to connect my webcam to a PC surveillance program. Does anyone have any other ideas on how to figure out who is doing this?
I feel that this has clearly become a pattern and is bound to get worse.",,vtrnxp,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/vtrnxp/potential_workplace_stalker/,office,1657224305.0

This is what happens when I go out with my coworkers,"I'm a person that likes to keep to oneself. I work in an office inside a Wearhouse with project managers and supervisor, etc. After a hard & chaotic work wave, my coworkers like to go out and celebrate a job well done. This usually means going to bar and having fun. I don't usually go since I have other commitments at home. BUT the last time I went, oh my god! it started out normally ,coworkers ordering drinks, talking about how we survived the work load, etc.  Once the drinks started taking affect one managers wanted to take photos with all the ""pretty girls"" from work, since it was rumored that he was well off, money wise, almost all the ""pretty girls"" he took a picture with said ""okay that will $XXX.00"". I first thought that they were joking but this man pulled a stack of cash and started paying THEM to take pictures! I was shocked.  I told one of my coworkers (who has been working for the company much longer than me) what had happen and she said that's normal. Some time pass and I went to the bathroom and heard my coworkers confessed to sleep with other coworkers and managers. when I came out the bathroom I caught one floor manager (married w/ kids) kissing and office clerk (single). when I got my table with the coworkers I was hanging out with, my ex-boss (story for another time) was drunk and giving ""good vides"" to another floor manager, next thing we know, guy almost fainted. Now rumors circled around work that he is witch/wizard. Office clerk confessed to me that he following day she only kiss floor manager out of pity and that he went for a 2nd kiss but she rejected him.

I went to culinary school for fun -- cooking is one of the few passions I have. 

Here is the question : 

I HATE cooking for myself, it brings me no joy. But I live alone and obviously spend most of my time in the office  (I work in a manufacturing plant) --- as a woman in a male dominated industry, does it discount my professionalism or authority if I bring food into the office for my co workers to try?

3 Reasons Why You Should Take Your Work Outside," 

Ever thought of working outside in a park, caf√©, or any other outdoor location? Most people argue that it is not a good idea to take your work outside. But working outdoor has a lot of benefits. It makes your mind fresh, improves your moods, shifts the environment from a boring office to something new, make your work a fun and much more. All these benefits indicate the same thing, productive work. In this article, we will tell you three main reasons why you should take your work outside.

## 1. Lowers Stress

No matter if you are working remotely or inside office premises, you will have a lot of work-related stress that can even double if you do not change your environment. Also, the workload itself just adds more to the stress level. Higher stress means less concentration on work, lower efficiency, and productivity. So, how to overcome it? The answer is simple to begin working outside.

Go to your favorite coffee spot, order a latte, open your laptop, and start working. Along with refreshing your mind, it will also lower your stress by providing a different working condition. You can also invite your peers and team members to come for work-related discussions. Parks also make a good choice for lowering stress while working from home outside. As highlighted above, nature itself is a mood changer. Charge your laptop, go to the park, sit for a while to release your stress, breath in the fresh air, and then start working. You will work more efficiently, and your mind will be more productive. Try that.

## 2. Improves Health

Health benefit is another important reason why everybody suggests coming out of your [work pods](https://www.autonomous.ai/pods/autonomous-work-pod) and working outside. While working outdoors, employees move. It‚Äôs not like the office desk and table where they spend hours sitting in the same position.

When outside, whenever you feel exhausted, you can easily walk, move, and do exercises. Movements will increase your blood flow, maintain heart rate, help you burn calories, and much more. It brings a lot of health benefits to the list. Plus, the sunlight will also improve the vitamin D quantity in your body. Ultimately, you will have healthier physic.

## 3. Works As Positive Distraction 

Working outside brings positive distractions to your daily schedule. While sitting in your home office wood pod or office, your mind becomes exhausted. You hardly find any positive distraction being surrounded by work all the time. Just staring outside the window, feeling the fresh breeze, or even looking at the sky can be refreshing sometimes. These are some of the positive distractions that improve productivity and concentration on work. Sometimes, such distractions become necessary to work better.

These are some of the key reasons why you should choose to work outdoors. If your mind still does not accept its benefits, then we suggest you give it a try. Take your laptop, go to a park, and work there. You will surely feel more productive, focused, and efficient and have a positive result.",dandy-2902,vqkt2q,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/vqkt2q/3_reasons_why_you_should_take_your_work_outside/,office,1656864267.0

How to Motivate Employees to Work Better?,"Depending on several factors, the productivity in your office could be decreasing by the minute. This could happen due to several reasons which are difficult to predict or even specify. To make your work easier, I have collected tips to motivate employees.

## Tip 1: Listen to their needs

What most employers miss is to listen to what their employees need from them or the work they are getting. By focusing your attention on their requirements, you will give them a feeling of being heard, which will motivate them to work better, put their best foot forward and boost their productivity.

This will also create a sense of friendship and comfort between you and them.

## Tip 2: Create a positive office culture

The kind of culture you have in the office greatly depends on the employer. If the culture is productive but positive, your employees would feel more comfortable and at home. This would ease them up and inspire them to work more and better.

## Tip 3: Keep a challenge

It is only human to get attracted to a challenge that will make you feel more alive and excited. IF you set up a small goal or challenge among your employees, you would be able to motivate employee performance to a much greater extent.

## Tip 4: Keep fair payroll

Another way to keep your employees motivated to work for you is to reward them well. Make them feel comfortable like working in their home office. No one would want to work for someone who doesn‚Äôt treat them well or has or doesn‚Äôt value them. If you keep the payroll considerate and deserving, your employees would perform better and give you much better results.

Best noise canceling headphones for work?,"What comfortable noise canceling headphones do you recommend for work? With good sound quality, call/zoom connection and quality, comfortable and durable. Sony or bose? I see all for sale except Sony XM5.

Noise-canceling headsets for office and multiple people calling or having meetings,"Hello! I need some help, I would love to hear from you guys. 

I am looking for some headsets to buy for my office. We mostly use Jabra and it is the easiest one for me to convince the company to buy but other brands could be possible too. 

**Environment:**

We will sit 2-3 people (most of the time just 2) in the same office room. There are maybe 3+ meters between us. At times we will have calling sessions or video meetings together. Sometimes we will be in separate calls/meetings. Sometimes the same. 

  
**Problem:**

When I have a call, watching a video, or in a  video meeting, I can hear the other person in the same room talking and therefore cannot concentrate. If in the same meeting we have to mute our mics when the other talks. 

**Requirements:**

\- On-ear (My boss doesn't like overear, although I realize it could be more isolating if we went with that)

\- Wireless

\-  At least 2 device support - should be able to link up to PC (Lenovo Thinkpad) and Phone (Apple iPhone) at the same time so it's easy to switch. 

\- Noise-canceling /ANC/ Microphone- so that we can have multiple conversations in the same room without hearing each other and that the person we are talking to doesn't hear other people.

**Like to have:**

\- Jabra or a well-known brand. 

\- Docking station - the current headset is the Jabra  Pro 9465. It has like a docking station that charges the headset. It also has a panel that you can use to click on to accept or decline calls and more. Also for video meetings when you take them off and put them on it automatically connects and opens the meeting.   At the very least it would be nice to have a charging station.

\-Comfortable - I assume all will be to some extent. But like what do call centers, control rooms, and others use? They have many conversations next to each other and I can assume they have the same needs as I described above.  


**What are we looking at:**

I am looking at the Jabra Evolve 75 MS. This only has a charging station, but as far as I can see fulfills all other requirements. The Jabra Engage 75 was a good option too but doesn't have ANC which I think might be too important to miss given the above requirements but seems to have everything else. There is also PNC (which I guess is instead of ANC) but I am worried about that not being enough.

Unhealthy competition from team member?,"I'm leading a team, where this guy joined 8 months ago.
On one of our calls he commented about how ""we're all of the same group and it's just that (I) have a longer work experience so I'm leading the team"".
Since then I've realised competitive vibes from him.
He's quite slow at work and my manager has asked to be in touch with him regularly and that he needs some pushing because ""he has had some issues in the past that made him this way"" (they had a""bonding"" session over some drinks & weed at an event).

The other day in a team + manager meeting he was questioned on why a particular task was taking so long to implement. And one other pending task of his was reassigned to another teammate. A few minutes later (a while after that conversation thread was over) he asked why is one of my tasks delayed by such a long time period. I responded on the reasons behind the delay, although the reasons were regularly being communicated during our daily standups. The next day in our standup, it was communicated to the rest of the team that his task would be picked up by someone else. Some time later he asked the same question again about my task in front of the wider audience ... I shared the latest updates again including the progress made the day before, as part of my usual standup updates.

But I know very well he is retaliating because questions are being raised on his task. And the tone of his questions relays the same as well.

UX Designer to Product Manager,"I am a self taught UX Designer working for 3 years, and 7+ years in graphic design. I am 20. The company that I work for is a startup working on a healthcare platform. For the past two years they've reached nowhere, its been a total wastage of time and money. I was the only one who was doing something in that organization. The others just took for the paycheck. The team has shrunken from 60+ to 8 people including me.

I discussed the problem with the CEO of the company who's working on building this startup, and discussed about all of the effecting factors where he went wrong, cuz I've been observing everything since the beginning. And I've also learned about product management. And I got some pretty good problem solving skills which I'm very confident about. So I told him to change my role from a UX Designer to a Product Manager. He agreed, but told that he'd title me only after he sees some positive outcome through my work in the specific period of time.

I'm confident about me and my skills, but my co workers are absolute cunts. They've no knowledge about anything. They were assigned a task to collect info about emergency services, pharmacy, doctor consultation, pregnancy care, mental health assistance... and around 20 more things. What they did was... they kept pushing the deadline from 1 week to 2 weeks, then a month, and then 2 months, and stretched to 3 whole months. And what they presented was equivalent to a homework done by a middleschooler, or maybe worse. Nothing relevant, just filled the pages with some random copypasta.

Two third of them got fired, and a few are still there. I know they're peebrains too. I've planned on a thing to reveal their actual abilities in front of everyone, cuz until now they worked in groups, and if asked about something, they said that they did it together and the actual person who was the unfit kind wasn't being caught. Now that I got the power, I know of the ways to milk them individually and leave them no chance for any excuses.

What I wanna know is that how would I approach my employer to convey him for getting them fired... Cuz I know that if they stay around, this product is never gonna grow. They have no skills whatsover, and when I discuss some pretty basic things like card sorting or value proposition canvas, they waste most of my time in trying to CORRECT ME. Mind that they have no knowledge, they do it cuz of their ego, that I'm just 20, was 18 when I joined this company. They bring up stupid stuff. So I used to be a UX Designer here, and so the product must be according to the feasibility of the user ofcourse, for which I did the user research and created a user persona, now they poke their nose into it and tell me to design the userflow according to what they say and not the actual user, and they *assume* a bunch of stuff about the user. Which is big no no, when it comes to UX. You're not supposed to assume. They don't know shit.

There were other professional guys too, but they got better opportunities and they switched.

You might be wondering that why I'm still working here and not looking for a better opportunity. Actually I'm in college pursuing BFA in animation (animation provided the most things to learn of all courses). And I wanna continue my career in UX design by doing my masters in HCI in the US. Also, I need the security free loan (prodigy and alike) and scholarships, so if I maintain my position in one organization and make a change, I'll be having a strong thing to show off in my resume.

I see myself doing it in this company, also the idea of this product can bring fortunes, all it needs is the right execution. I believe in myself, but I wanna get rid of this leeches who're stopping it from happening.

Sorry if this was too much and unnecessary, I ranted :|",shaikmudassir,uoyuv8,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/uoyuv8/ux_designer_to_product_manager/,office,1652468685.0

Best Office Layout For Two Desks You Should Try in Your Office,"The challenge of setting up a single-person home office is an easy one. But, what if you and a buddy, twin, sibling, roommate, or spouse want to design an office layout for two desks. Increasing numbers of individuals are working from home or freelancing thus this is a very convenient idea for many houses.

When it comes to working in a shared space, an office layout for two desks is the best option for most households. It's better for your health and productivity to have a shared workspace at home. A well-designed two-person home office makes it possible for a variety of individuals with varying requirements to work together in harmony. As a result, there's even more motivation to think about what to do next.

## Best Ways To Arrange Office Layout For Two Desks

### Selecting Right Desks

For home usage, we don't advocate normal, cumbersome, and unsuitable desks. A standing desk for the home office would be a better and healthier solution. These desks may now be found in a wide variety of sizes, designs, and fits, making it simple to perform extensive research, while helping you set up an office layout for two desks. An adjustable standing desk may either be powered by an electric motor or manually operated by a crank mechanism.

### Build Double-sided Shelved Cabinets

This is a good option for people who wish to utilize their current workspaces and facilities for their business needs. Consider utilizing the lowest shelf of a long cupboard as a work area if you have a lot of stuff. This is a reasonable assumption that the cabinet is wide enough to fit two individuals and their work supplies.

### Get Good Ergonomic Chairs

The correct chair with armrests is essential for a comfortable sitting experience. The bottom section of the back panel should be curved to provide additional back support. Under the chair, the back panel, the armrests, and the base of an ergonomic chair are all places where the chair's adjustability may be found.

### The Right Space

People have different preferences when it comes to their work environments. Some love to be surrounded by wide areas, while others prefer to take frequent breaks. When designing your space, think about your own personal preferences. If you're going to be taking a lot of breaks, make sure your dual office layout has plenty of open space. Position the workstation such that you can view the rest of the room if you require open areas. There is a workstation facing the wall and a window for those who are easily distracted.

### Get Curved Desk Pairing

A curved desk is one of the most underappreciated office desk designs for two people. In the office, you're more likely to notice them, but at home, you're more likely to see them overlooked. They are, nonetheless, very adaptable. Employees should face one corner of the workspace while using them.",dandy-2902,uji99v,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/uji99v/best_office_layout_for_two_desks_you_should_try/,office,1651823192.0

Ideas for an office with no social/downtime,"Hello people of Reddit! I supervise in an office that was recently acquisitioned by a corporation. The nature of our work is one that leaves no social time. We are a 24hr office so it is rare for more than a couple of people to have lunch at the same time. People come in to the office but must work in isolated booths. The work is time-sensitive so if employees are schedule on a task they cannot do anything but that. Before the acquisition folks had time between work tasks to socialize. Our schedule has now been optimized so much so that there is no time for colleagues to communicate, it has only, essentially, left them time for bathroom breaks. I worry about the mental health of the people I manage. I am new to management and this change just happened. I am struggling to find ways to retain staff/keep people positive.

Best Office Layout Inspiration In 2022," 

People's motivations for rearranging their offices differ from one another. Your organization may be moving to a new site, and you're looking for some creative ideas. Perhaps your coworkers are just looking for a change of pace. Whatever the case may be, using fresh ideas for office layout inspiration may offer various advantages.

A change of location may boost employee morale. Work might get monotonous and boring after a while if you're in the same place all the time. Improved office layout inspiration and design also make a better first impression on prospective customers.

Building a few desks and a few cubicles is only the beginning of the process of setting up an office. What [kind of office design](https://www.autonomous.ai/ourblog/15-productive-office-layout-ideas) can you use for your business? We will guide and help you explore your choices to find the greatest office layout inspiration.

## Office Layout Inspiration Ideas To Refresh Your Office:

### 1. Cellular Office Layout

One of the most common office layouts, the cellular office, is efficient. In this case, if you detect an increase in your employee's productivity. They are usually arranged in a sequential manner to ensure that each employee has their own personal area. As a result, employees are free to carry out their responsibilities in whatever way they see suitable. This design creates a workplace that is both focused and methodical.

### 2. Coworking Office Layout

Employees have the option of choosing where they want to work based on their own preferences. Workers or teams might be assigned particular work zones based on their responsibilities. Entrepreneurs that want to foster a sense of community among their employees would appreciate this office layout as inspiration for their place of business.

### 3. Open Office Layout:

These low walls tend to divide the whole floor area. An office standing desk is available for employees to use, but they may also opt to share one with their colleagues. Individual ergonomic seats and laptops are provided to all workers, regardless of whether they work in a traditional office or a virtual one.

### 4. Low Partition Office Layout

Inspired by the cubicle office layout idea, a low partition office is created. However, the walls in this layout tend to have a lower height than the cubicle form of workstations. As a result, workers are able to communicate and collaborate more effectively in this style of workplace structure.

### 5. Hybrid Office Layout

Hybrid work models provide a great deal of flexibility for businesses when it comes to arranging their workspaces. To put it simply: With a hybrid work schedule choice, you get the best of both worlds.

You get the best of both worlds with a cellular and open office layout in a combined design. As a result, individual cubicles may be used to separate the space, but they take up less room. They also don't depend on doors or windows for separation in the hybrid work-from-home configuration.",dandy-2902,u4zf9y,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/u4zf9y/best_office_layout_inspiration_in_2022/,office,1650120710.0

And then one day, I decided to work overtime because my video project is nearly done. When I finish packed up and decided to back home, I realize the entrance door and the folding gate is locked and my key was missing.

The situation now is that I'm trapped and I call my co-worker (2nd closest) to help me. She didn't believe it at first, so I video call her. We laughed about it for a while and she want to help me to go to my boss house for getting the key.

How to deal with a coworker you can‚Äôt stand?,"I joined a great company a year ago, split my time between two offices and visited other locations on and off. I now have an employee so have been moved to work from 1 office (still visit other locations but few and far between at the minute). 

The office is open plan and overcrowded - we are waiting for management to push forward with renovations to spilt the office up. 

The only free desk for me is right in the middle of another department and the manager of that departments personality is really grinding my gears. I‚Äôve endured it for two months, but am at the point where I can‚Äôt tolerate it anymore, it is effecting the quality of my work I feel.  Personality and management wise we are complete opposites. 

This person I find to be extremely loud, gossipy, belittles others (but in such a way they will say it was a joke) they are also snippy and rude when trying to have a work conversation. However they will compliment what you‚Äôre wearing a few minutes later. They have been at the company for 20 years and are the most senior in that office. No one else ever challenges them, I feel like they just try to silently ignore the person at times and put up with the behaviour as they have been there longest. 

So, how do I approach this with my senior manager without looking unprofessional saying, I can‚Äôt stand this person and am not sitting there again when there is no where else currently for me to go?

[Survey]: Remote Work/Return to Office," https://bgsu.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_dpejzhEq54BKuoK  

Hi, I'd really appreciate if you would take this survey and/or send it to others who might qualify! The goal of this survey and my PhD dissertation is to better understand worker attitudes toward remote work and return-to-office transitions. Ultimately I hope this research can help illuminate the benefits of employee choice of work location for organizations determining expectations following the pandemic.

To qualify for participation, you must have previously worked remotely and have since been required to return to onsite work for at least 2 days per week. If you're not sure if you qualify, click through and the survey will tell you. Participation takes around 10-15 minutes, and those who finish the survey will be entered into a drawing for one of four $100 Amazon gift cards.

Please feel free to share this survey invitation with others who may fit the qualifications. Thank you in advance for your help and participation!",iopsychresearcher,u0k6ra,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/u0k6ra/survey_remote_workreturn_to_office/,office,1649605269.0

He is sensitive, and he has strong ties to the company's owner, so I can't face him.

How can you integrate new hires into a remote team,"I feel like this is a problem most remote teams encounter regularly. A new person joins the team, a lot of effort is put into onboarding them so they can work properly, and they maybe get a 5-minute introduction to the team on a regular Zoom/Teams/Slack call. They start working and after 2-3 months, they still are just a name and an email address to almost all team members except their closest collaborators.¬†

"Many Many Many events/projects, very little tools","Hi all,

&#x200B;

Ive recently started a new job with a start up that is not very equiped in tools/software. They are working towards more financial security and will profesionalise once those funds are secured. Currently they are working with a team of independants and only a few actual hires of which i am one.

&#x200B;

So much time is lost by a lack of oversight. I notice people being surprised all the time by tasks and deadlines. And im in turn surprised by the lack of organisation in all these project

Since the budget is very limited right now I am looking for some free/cheap project management / event management tools that can help me out for the forseeable future. Preferably software that we will be able to upgrade to pro pack once there will be more funding, but that is usable in the free/cheap form.

What im looking for is a tool that will allow me to create a timeline throughout the year, for the overall projects and to break those projects down in tasks with deadlines that can be assigned as tasks to people, preferably working with Outlook. 

&#x200B;

Im guessing i want too much for the money that is (not) available but I also know many orgs (or more the people working in these orgs) struggle with this, so i'd not be surprised if this wheel is indeed allready invented. Im even condsidering just finding an excel spreadsheet to help me out here, but that sort of goes against my religion :D.",WorkyDorkyDoo,twostu,2,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/twostu/many_many_many_eventsprojects_very_little_tools/,office,1649141472.0

How to fix an unorganized and messy office building,"TLDR; Moved into new office and movers placed heavy filing cabinets and equipment in the middle of the building and there is no space to move it anywhere else.  


I was hired about a year ago and before I started, the department I am in was moved to a new office, which is basically just like one of those school portables/double wide trailers.   It was a bunch of random people that moved everything so there have been filing cabinets randomly placed throughout the office blocking walkways and just getting in the way. Half of the files were also just randomly placed in different offices so a good part of my job the last year was just trying to find where old files were placed.    


One of our offices is now the ""miscellaneous"" room that we have to keep closed.  Most of the cabinets are way too heavy to move and there are only about 2 or 3 of us there at a time and just don't have the ability to move everything.  I don't have the strength to move a 600 pound fire proof filing cabinet and some of my coworkers have injuries preventing them from doing any kind of lifting, pushing, pulling, etc.   


Many of the files still have to be kept but it would take us weeks of ignoring our work to get this place organized and put together properly.   


Does anyone have any tips on how to fix this or what department in a company would maybe be able to help out?",remosiracha,tt8es0,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/tt8es0/how_to_fix_an_unorganized_and_messy_office/,office,1648757149.0

Basically something to schedule and organise our team much better!

We already use the outlook calendar/agendas for our own personal/daily schedules but need a way of making all the information above accessible and live to members of a team.

Interpersonal relationship conflicts are magnified by issues with the built environment in a workplace.,"&#x200B;

[Photo by Zach Miles on Unsplash](https://preview.redd.it/z29d762a10p81.jpg?width=898&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=08e67f1e562873f607ff03d9b46d08b29d4258c9)

A recent poll suggests the number of issues that result from interpersonal relationship conflicts in a workplace are typically twice the number of issues that people have with the built environment.

But the amazing fact is, having¬†no¬†issues at all is much¬†less¬†likely by a factor of 10.¬†¬†More than 90% have experienced problems either with interpersonal relationships, the built environment, or both.

Can a space reduce problems attributed to interpersonal relationship conflicts? The right space, both in form and function, can prevent bad things from getting worse.

Working in a company owned space is usually the most challenging.  This is also true for interpersonal relationship conflicts in a flex space.

But flex spaces have other advantages. And problems that result from interpersonal relationship conflicts can be most effectively managed in positive communal settings that remain constructive and promote respect.¬†

To go along with that pink theme, it turns out you can get quite in-depth in decorating your home office with pink material. Sure, you can, of course, paint the walls and the ceiling pink if you so choose, but now you could take it to an entirely different level and have an entire office with pink gadgets and pink camera stands and such.

overworked?,"Hi I dont usually post what i do for work but its kinda getting upsetting over the last 6 months since i started here. I was initially hired as an intake to take phone calls at the small family run business i work at after my friend got me to work for here since its their company. They have 2 companies and I work at the other one and its really hard since its in the medical field and it can be tough especially as a full time nursing student who also works full time for them. Over time I saw how unorganized everything was here and how each worker here is always gone and doesnt come in the office on time (our work starts at 8:30am). The ""HR"" was the oldest son of the administrator and he is such an alcoholic and manipulator. I never told told them anything about him puking in the morning and him making do everything because he doesnt care. Up to he point that he got terminated on the day I was not at work. Now I'm always left alone doing HR, payroll/paycheck, intake, purchasing of our inventory and other stuff that was not in my job description. There are times that I would get 3 phone calls and i'm all alone in the office. Its super depressing and the fact that i'm only getting paid $18 an hour as the office manager is kinda shitty bc I didn't ask for this position and they just ""promoted"" me with no pay raise.

Meeting Agenda importance and templates!,"**Why meeting agendas are important**

Even the most basic meeting agenda is instrumental in making a meeting a good use of your time. By having an agenda, all meeting participants know what you expect of them.  


As you fill out your meeting agenda, here are some tips to make it even more helpful:  


**Use action verbs in your agenda.**  


Instead of noting something nondescript like ‚ÄúHiring discussion‚Äù explain what should happen. E.g., ‚ÄúDiscuss whether to hire another marketer this quarter.‚Äù  


**Agendas should be as short as possible, but as long as necessary.**  


If you find your agenda is going on for multiple pages, it sounds like you have some information to share BEFORE the meeting. Move that content to another doc and send it as something to review pre-meeting.  


**Share your agenda Google Doc in advance of the meeting.**  


Send your agenda to participants at least one day before the meeting. That way, they can organize their thoughts around any critical discussion topics. Better yet, ask participants to fill in bullet points for sections where they will be contributing to the meeting.

Save your back! Top considerations when setting up a home office.,"I think one of the most important considerations when designing an office is the long-term impact it can have on your health. 

Additionally, my mom is a **licensed Physical Therapist in Kentucky** and many of her patients struggle with back pain. There is a lot of advice she has to offer to supplement her physical therapy, because recovery also requires a healthy lifestyle and I wanted to pass along her advice for setting up your office...

For your desk chair, you need to know what actually matters when choosing a desk chair for your back. So ask these questions...

**Does** **the actual seat pan tilts forward?** Of all the actual so-called features, this one is perhaps the biggest non-negotiable. You need to be able to tilt forward the actual angle of what you are sitting upon in order to properly execute the ‚ÄúHome Base‚Äù position of sitting on the edge of the seat. In this position, your knees are below your pelvis and you are sitting on the edge of the seat. NOTE: the ability to tilt the seat forward can also help reduce the knee pain that you often feel during long bouts of sitting. How does it do that? The angle of the chair better aligns your whole leg so that your patella tendon isn‚Äôt pressed against the back of your kneecap with the same amount of force.

**Does it have solid lumbar support?** This will allow you to sit with your knees at the same level as your pelvis but with your back resting against your lumbar support. Ideally, the lumbar support is independently adjustable from the backrest. But it‚Äôs also fine if the lumbar support is adjustable insofar as it can move up and down with the backrest.

**Do you have the ability to sit in multiple positions?** You CANNOT stay in one position all day.. So, besides supporting the two ‚Äúhome base‚Äù sitting positions, your desk chair needs to be able to support general adjustments in how you are sitting throughout the day. Side note: that‚Äôs the problem with rigid desks: you typically can‚Äôt raise your chair and sit underneath it.

**Does it have adjustable armrests?** it‚Äôs important to be able to rest your arms or have them share the load throughout the day. So, armrests are a good thing. But, they need to be at an appropriate height and width from your shoulders so that you aren‚Äôt forced to slouch when using them. It‚Äôs also important that they are adjustable so that you can roll your chair close to the desk and have the chair be able to go under the desk surface.

You can read the [full post here](https://posturre.com/how-to-choose-an-office-chair/) if you want to know all the factors you should consider.

Second, here a few of the health benefits of having a standing desk...

**1.) You are able to switch between sitting and standing.**

If you‚Äôre working at a desk all day, this is the best way to put the least amount of stress on the spine. Here‚Äôs the logic: 

1. Standing all day = fantastic for the spinal discs in your lower back but tougher on facet and sacroiliac (SI) joints. And it can also be hard on your feet (think plantar fasciitis).  . 
2. Sitting all day = easier on your feet and joints but rougher on your lower spinal discs. 
3. Conclusion: You need to switch it up.

**2.) It gives you customizable desk height for perfect posture.**

It‚Äôs pretty simple‚Ä¶

Perfect desk height exists for the sitting and standing positions.

Every person is different.

Therefore, everyone‚Äôs perfect desk height is different and we can pretty much guarantee that your perfect desk height doesn‚Äôt fit a cookie cutter height like 30 inches ‚Äì it probably reads more like 27.385 inches.

An adjustable standing desk is likely the only option if you want to have your desk at the perfect height for your back.

You can read the [full post](https://posturre.com/benefits-of-standing-desk-for-your-back/) I wrote that covers the all of the benefits of a standing desk for your back and why you should consider getting one...

Finally, If I've convinced you to consider prioritizing your health in your office decision, I literally spent over 50 hours scouring the Internet and researching the [best desk chairs](https://posturre.com/best-desk-chairs-for-back-pain/) and [best standing desks](https://posturre.com/best-standing-desks-for-back-pain/) for your back.

You will find tons of lists from all kinds of companies and organizations. Even news outlets like *USA Today* or the *Chicago Tribune* have their own lists of the best chairs and standing desks.

So, I googled it.¬†Reviewed the lists.¬†

And came to this conclusion: **most of the ‚ÄúBest Desk Chair‚Äù or ""Best Standing Desks"" lists online are either bad or fake news.**

Here‚Äôs why:

1. No clear, solid selection criteria
2. Too many options
3. Terribly written evaluations & comparisons
4. Products selected for affiliate and referral revenue

So, I decided to do things differently.¬†

To create these lists, I:

1. Spent 50+ hours researching over 60 different desk chairs and standing desks in detail.
2. Consulted an actual physical therapist (my mom)
3. Made selections on what actually matters for your back (as detailed in the posts above)
4. Limited the list to only a few categories and selections for multiple budgets
5. Wrote clear & concise reviews
6. Created a chart for easily comparing features that matter

Small office: Cleaners during working hours seems a little disruptive,"I work at a fairly small company which has a small office building.  The company owner uses a cleaning service to clean the office once a week every Wednesday - Things like emptying the garbage, vacuuming the floor, cleaning the bathroom, etc.  The issue is they come to clean the office during the workday, which I think is a bit disruptive, especially if one of us is in an online meeting or phone call with someone, etc..  We do software development, so the type of work we do normally requires concentration.

I have an online meeting every day at 4PM (which is a quick status meeting that usually lasts about 15-30 minutes).  Today, the cleaners happened to arrive right around that time and started vacuuming and making other noise right away, during my online meeting.

Would it be reasonable to mention my concern about work disruption when the cleaners are here?  I'm wondering if it would be possible for the cleaners to come later in the evening when people generally aren't in the office.

The company owner is usually here during the day, so I'm sure he must be aware of possible work disruptions.  One day I even heard the company owner mention to the cleaners that they had a phone call (presumably to ask them for some quiet).

&#x200B;

Some more info: Up until a few weeks ago, there was just one guy who came to do the office cleaning, and normally he'd arrive at around 5PM or shortly after.  While there was some disruption, I didn't think that was too big of a deal because any online meetings & such things usually end before then.  However, now there are 2 people who come to do the office cleaning, and they arrive anywhere between noon and 4PM.  They also take more time with the office cleaning (one thing they do is mop the floor, which the previous guy didn't do).",RolandMT32,szwxat,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/szwxat/small_office_cleaners_during_working_hours_seems/,office,1645663143.0

Angel or Arrogant?,"My office is supposed to reopen for in-person work from next week. The flight ticket from my city to the place of work was around $300 on Sunday (one-fifth of my income) and on Tuesday it was $100. I requested my boss to travel on Tuesday instead of Sunday. 

The boss refused and directed that I land on Sunday itself. BUT he also offers to sponsor the differential $200. 

Now, I have booked a 6 hour layover flight which is $150 because I did not want to burden my office. 

I am confused now- is my boss an angel (because he indeed offered that the office would pay the difference in fare price); or is it weird (because no one would need to pay a higher price if I could travel just a day later.

What Are The Modern Office Trends?,"**Remote work is the predominant work model, but office work isn‚Äôt over yet**

Remote work has been excellent for many people, as it has allowed them to unlock their full potential while working comfortably in an environment adjusted to their needs. There are struggles, but an organized and clean workspace at home can help you become more productive and efficient.

All companies use a different approach to keep their workflow balanced and constant even when more than half of their employees are at home. Despite that, many sources argue that working at the office is still necessary.

It‚Äôs quite complicated to mimic the same level of collaboration, innovation and energy that we have during in-person meetings. While remote work can be beneficial for individual workers, multidisciplinary teams may experience more productivity, efficiency and less stress while working with their teammates at the office.

**Hot desking, office hoteling and other unassigned seats trends in the modern office**

The COVID-19 pandemic has increased our needs for collaboration more than ever. However, this same era has made us reevaluate how we meet at office spaces, which led eventually to the adoption of hot desking and office hoteling, to mention a few models.

These organizational models imply ‚Äúunassigned seats‚Äù at the office, allowing each employee  access to the best area to complete their work at that specific moment. Furthermore, hot desking and office hoteling also imply different office spaces oriented toward co-working, like ‚Äúthink spaces‚Äù with atmosphere accustomed to the needs of the workers, such as blush tones.

While this modern office trend isn‚Äôt new, it has become more common in 2022. According to studies, assigned desks are dirtier than toilet seats. So, besides being a more convenient option for most people, it‚Äôll be easier to maintain an organized and cleaner office space.

**Nature-focused office design for better air circulation and quality**

The benefits of bringing nature to the office are undeniable. For instance, studies say that keeping plants at the office can help you stay focused and productive throughout the day. Furthermore, just having a few plants at the office can improve the air quality in that space.

Besides plants, other materials like copper or brass (which are naturally antimicrobial) have become quite prominent in today‚Äôs workforce post-coronavirus.

Besides blush tones or softer colors, these modern office trends have proved to be predominant in 2022.",dandy-2902,sqn91m,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/sqn91m/what_are_the_modern_office_trends/,office,1644656212.0
New to the office scene... feel annoyed.,"So is it like a thing to just plop random information in an email with very little context and expect me to know what to do with it? Whenever I send an email I spell stuff out very clearly about what certain information is and basically explain the context and always open it up for questions.  
Meanwhile, I get emails loaded with random acronyms and stuff and it's just confusing.  
""Here's the H-49 from last week's run-through. au23enenqai3424. Do you have the window?""

The honest response to that email is "" What's an H-49? Am I supposed to be going to run-throughs? The window for what?"" (okay this is an exaggerated example but this is what it feels like)

It's been 3 months since I started and there has been zero official training.. just "" ask if you have any questions "" but every time I ask I feel like they expect me to know how to figure this stuff out on my own... there's a wealth of information around me .. but it's poorly organized and basically as clear as the emails I get.

Furthermore... I have caught on to some things... such as this request process we go through for getting clearance to access certain resources. But I have a super-senior lead person who tells me... ""contact so-and-so for access"" ... but I will go find the appropriate request code and come back with... is it just this request? and the senior will say "" yeah but you should contact the people I told you to contact anyways "" ... so I do.... and the response from the people he told me to contact is, ""you need to submit the request for access to this with this code"" !!!! I get really annoyed cause the person who's been there for 20 years is making me look like I didn't even learn how to do that part of the job right. This guy is all about "" contacting the people "" but he doesn't \*seem\* to get that him contacting someone creates a much greater sense of urgency than when I do.

Then they're like... ask questions if you don't understand something... so yesterday I was being asked to do something that's not really in my job description but I kinda thought it was a good thing to know how to do... but I had a few questions so I sent thru our chat service the questions.. it was one question... then ten minutes later another... then a little later one more and I immediately get a phone call from this guy who's the supervisor of the guy who should have been doing this task and he sounded super annoyed and said "" you're typing a lot... what's going on? can I help""; I guess it's cool he's offering his help... but the initial tone really bothered me... I'm supposed to ask questions but also not really... that's just something they say to make it seem like they're being nice to the new people but when you do ask they treat you like an annoying little brother who can't tie his shoes.

I've been remote the entire time and this is my first office job, so there are just a lot of situations I don't know how to handle. I'm definitely going to stop contacting people for access to resources even when a super-senior guy tells me so.

I'm probably being too sensitive, but I needed to rant - maybe someone can confirm that this is a normal feeling being new somewhere or maybe someone can tell me that I'm fucking up in a certain way so I can get underneath it.

The third - sixth weeks were so great! I had enough understanding of processes and my system set up finally .. and I was taking on tasks and completely understanding everything, and killing the tasks and getting praised for it. Then everything changed they shifted me to a different project and gave me more boring/complicated work... I don't know if I'm performing as well as they expected, but I definitely miss the easier work that I'm actually qualified for that I was doing before.",emryne,sq7ce2,6,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/sq7ce2/new_to_the_office_scene_feel_annoyed/,office,1644607435.0
How To Become Top Performer At Work - Water-Walkers vs. Swimmers,"The following video guide explains a distinction between two kinds of performers on work: [Water-Walkers vs. Swimmers: How To Be More Successful At Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZW2wDUO7WU)

* Swimmer: A strong performer.
* Water-Walker: The rare one-of-a-kind hire who changes the trajectory of any company he or she joins.

The video above provides an analysis of 6 behaviors that waterwalkers consistently do:

* When confronted with a severe business crisis, the waterwalker focuses all energy on how they will overcome the crisis and still deliver; the swimmer will often focus instead on doing a superb job of ‚Äúselling‚Äù a lower base.
* Waterwalkers consistently focus on self-improvement and asking themselves, ‚ÄúHow do I get better everyday?‚Äù Swimmers focus more on self-promotion and ask themselves, ‚ÄúHow do I sell myself and get myself positioned to get the promotion I deserve?‚Äù
* Waterwalkers make any assignment a great assignment; swimmers think success or failure is based upon having a ‚Äúgood assignment‚Äù.
* Waterwalkers always approach a topic from the standpoint of ‚Äúhow crisp and clear can I make it?‚Äù Swimmers tend to measure success by how long, how many charts, and how many numbers they can put on one page. They erroneously equate quality with quantity.
* Waterwalkers recognize the power of developing people as THE way to achieving their business goals; Swimmers tend to prefer to ‚Äúgo it alone‚Äù and consistently believe they alone must be the major driver.
* Finally, waterwalkers tend to be thinking, ‚ÄúHow do I change the game?‚Äù, whilst swimmers work on, ‚ÄúHow do I grow the business?‚Äù",thumbsdrivesmecrazy,spwm7g,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/spwm7g/how_to_become_top_performer_at_work_waterwalkers/,office,1644576382.0

Flexible Rules,"Hello! So quick background: Since we are on a new normal situation globally, so are the offices or workplaces. Now my position in the company concerns almost all the areas of the Sales Dept but my core is mostly admin. My boss spoke to me about revising the new normal rules/things we have to make it more flexible since in our area, the alert levels are changing almost every month (Alert level describes to how bad the situation is, so Alert Level 4 is the highest). Right now, we are A.L. 3. 

Things we do in the office:
-Social distancing
-Employees who report to office everyday are reduced to 50%
-Waste segragation
-Masks should be worn at all times
-Distribution of masks and vitamins monthly

Getting annoyed by kids in shared office,"This is a shared office in a basement, and my organisation is sharing space with a bunch of different things, like a charity store, a woodwork workshop etc..

Yesterday another person brought his cat in. Those 2 kids chased the cat, pulled it by the collar and stomped in front of the cat until the cat was really scared. Their mom took action only until like 20mins later. Today one of them start to play the things on my colleagues' desks, without asking of course.

I need the right words for this battle,"I need to have a serious conversation with my boss. I would love advice about what to say and how to say it. 

I started this job 6 months ago and I‚Äôm very qualified with many years of experience in this field. I work in the busiest most challenging branch of our entire company. It‚Äôs constantly stressful and I put out fires all day long. There is nothing I‚Äôm doing wrong. There are a lot of moving parts to this work and there are many things beyond our control that make this branch extremely difficult. I was warned about this even at my interview. I have new coworkers that have transferred from other departments that want to cry after their first day. They have told me that to say this branch is the most difficult is an extreme understatement. 

I have taken on the challenge. Every day I work my ass off. I put in all my hours and then some and almost never take a break. Not because I want to kiss ass. Simply because I really don‚Äôt have time. I try to make sure that I am doing my part and more to ensure things go smoothly for our clients as well as for my colleagues. Like I said so many moving parts and balls in the air. 

My immediate manager has a constant attitude with me.  She‚Äôs condescending and bitchy and I become a tongue tied mess because of how she is. So embarrassing. With anyone else I can hold my own and stand strong and I don‚Äôt know why I become a bumbling fucking idiot with her. My boss boss (above her) is very kind and goes out of his way to tell me what an amazing job I‚Äôm doing and how much they appreciate my hard work. 

My immediate manager worked my branch in my position before. Listening to her she makes it sound like she had it all whipped into shape and had time to twiddle her thumbs on top of it. Whether that‚Äôs true or not I know circumstances have changed and the branch has become busier and more complicated. We had some new people join our team and I knew right away the project they put together for this team was not going to work out. I saw the flaws from the beginning and told her this. She basically chewed me out and told me to stay in my lane (not in those exact words) and told me there was no reason they could not handle the new structure. 2 months later they scrapped the project and had to re-haul the whole thing just as I predicted. She‚Äôs reluctantly told me that we‚Äôre changing again without once admitting she was wrong or apologizing for her arrogance. 

The problem is she talks to me like I‚Äôm not pulling my weight. Basically I know she thinks I‚Äôm slow or inefficient or maybe wasting time by her tone and choice of words with me. When, honestly, I‚Äôm working my ass off everyday and everyone sees it and acknowledges it but her. When I tell her where I‚Äôm at in projects she responds ‚Äúoh so you HAVEN‚ÄôT done xyz??‚Äù. As if I‚Äôve been sitting around watching Netflix on the job all day. To top it off they want me to work on MORE projects. I have a hard enough time keeping my head above water with the day to day as it is. I‚Äôve had absolutely no ability to work on more things as much as I would like to. While people in other branches are working on projects all the time and climbing up the ladder in less than 1 year but their office circumstances are night and day from mine. Colleagues from other branches say they sympathize with me and offer to help ‚Äúwhenever I need it‚Äù just as sweet as can be. But when I have reached out for help or to delegate they have told me they are too busy and then cop an attitude if they actually have to do anything. 

It‚Äôs going to come to a head and I know it. We need to talk this out. But I know I‚Äôll make a fool of myself when I need to stand up for myself. I‚Äôm a damn 45 year old woman and this girl has to be at least 10 years my junior and she talks to me like I‚Äôm a child. It bugs the shit out of me. Please help me come up with the right things to say to get my point across

I put in 100% every day

No Im not lazy. There‚Äôs just THAT much work

How do I(23f) quit my office job without my boss(55m) taking his anger out on me?,"EDIT: he wants to take us five employees, all the other employees are 40/50y/o men, to the Florida Keys for a company trip?? I am so confused about this‚Ä¶I haven‚Äôt brought up my interview or possible job offer so I just said ‚Äúthat would be fun!‚Äù 

I began this position about 4 months ago and do accounting/office admin work. I am in no way experienced for this role and completely seft-taught when it comes to quickbooks and accounting. It‚Äôs a super laid back company with only 5 employees, so laid back he took me to P.f. chang‚Äôs for our interview‚Ä¶however, over these months I have grown to dislike him more and more. I found out the last girl quit because they were having an affair and both cheated on their significant others. (I am constantly listening to their drama and am looked at as a part time therapist.) He has made comments about me and my boyfriend not working out or how i‚Äôm a smart pretty lady, etc. It makes me uncomfortable because I know he probably did this to the last girl. Aside from that, I am EXTREMELY bored throughout the day, I‚Äôm talking 4 hours of down time out of my 5.5 hour day. I often come in 5-10 min late because I know I will not be busy and figured it didn‚Äôt matter. I have tried to fill my time with what my degree (marketing/PR) pertains to and created a facebook page. This still wasn‚Äôt enough. I feel like he constantly brings me down with pointing out mistakes I make because I AM NOT AN ACCOUNTANT. I‚Äôm done feeling like a failure and ‚Äúyoung and dumb‚Äù at this company. He scolded me today because a cleaning company (whom he let stay at his home unaccompanied) came into our office and I had to leave to go to staples. He was upset yesterday and said I understand. He came right back with ‚ÄúYeah, you understand but still did it.‚Äù with a sarcastic chuckle. He brought it up again today because I was in the middle of working on something and he was talking about personal issues, he said ‚Äúdo you hear me?‚Äù looking at my computer, i said ‚Äúi‚Äôm listening.‚Äù he then went on a rampage saying yeah i‚Äôm listening but left the office yesterday when he told me to stay there an accompany the ladies. (never said I MUST stay in office with them there) And hell, I went to get supplies. He then brought up my tardiness and how I have ‚Äúnot taken this job seriously‚Äù as if talking about sex and other inappropriate conversations is job-serious. I have sales interview Friday, and will most likely get because my cousin who is a veteran there and I have lots of customer service experience.  I want to take it but I am so scared to quit/put in my two weeks. I feel like we are not on the best of terms after he scolded me today and don‚Äôt want him to think it is based solely on our conversation today.

Advantages and disadvantages of recycled cartridge and compatible cartridge,"**Advantages and disadvantages of recycled cartridge and compatible cartridge**

&#x200B;

1. High quality printing, black is comparable to laser printer.

&#x200B;

2. Printing does not plug, ink does not dry up. Use the special ink of ""continuous jet ink cartridge"", print automatically, vibrate, filter and clean, all ink is consumed, and there is no plug. The ink does not dry up. The built-in balancer of the ink cartridge receives the electrical signal of the ink cartridge printing and turns on the air pressure switch. When it does not print, the ink cartridge automatically turns off the air pressure switch to close the contact between the ink and the air. The ink does not volatilize and the ink will never dry up.

&#x200B;

3. Increased capacity. The average capacity of black ink cartridge is 25-30ml, which is equivalent to 5 times of the original ink cartridge. One ink cartridge should be used for at least 5 years.

&#x200B;

4. Printing costs fell sharply.

&#x200B;

5. No maintenance, easy to use. After you use the ink in the box, the user can add it at will, which is as convenient as pouring the water from one cup into another. After adding, it can be printed directly on the computer without maintenance.

&#x200B;

6. High efficiency and long life. After the modified ""continuous jet ink cartridge"" is processed by corresponding technology, the ink cartridge can realize long-life, high-precision printing and can be reused.

&#x200B;

7. Low carbon, environmental protection and green printing are in line with the global trend of energy conservation, emission reduction and environmental protection.",Ok_SS66,rgo6wt,1,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/rgo6wt/advantages_and_disadvantages_of_recycled/,office,1639535562.0

Fresh out of college at 23... and struggling to transition to office life. Looking for advice and support,"I graduated in May 2021 with a BFA in graphic design. A bit of context, my whole family have worked in the public school systems, none of them have ever worked in an office setting.

I now work in an office and it's been a tough transition amonog my fellow peers and I (Those I graudated with.)

1. We all work at different companies but all of our companies, we find ourselves actually working overtime most days. Instead of a 40 hour week, it looks more like 45-50 hours salaried (No overtime pay). We are all stressed.
2. I have struggled with ADHD most of my life but in the school system I found people were forgiving with feedback and little mistakes not so much in design post-graduation
3. I'm 4 months in and the senior designer training me is suddenly gone-we don't know when he is coming back to the office. There are days where I really don't know the answers to questions
4. In school I always made the deadlines on time and was punctual with my work, even in team and large scale event projects, and at my internship. But now at my job 2-4 people are always in my files and deadlines get complicated with sudden changes and late feedback.
5. I feel like my physical and mental health are not doing their greatest. It's like a slow burn.
6. Getting used to office lingo and business culture is really strange. People are indirect and sometimes I'm not sure if I understand them fully.
7. My mom and family always sticked to one job, one place of work their whole life- that's because in the school system their pay was based off of the years they worked there, not completely tied to performance, I feel so stressed at my new place of work and always feel the need to step up and say yes to working overtime even when I know I shouldn't for that hope at a raise
8. Most of my circle are in the same situation I'm in but for even less benefits and pay. I can't really complain as my workplace isn't toxic but I feel like I struggle a lot and put a lot of pressure on myself to succeed. It's so hard with adhd as I'm constantly missing tiny details or rereading things. If you've made it this far thank you for reading my vent. I miss college and didn't know what I had until I didn't have it anymore. :( Life isn't fair, but I wish 2 years of my college weren't flushed down the drain to covid, I would do anything in the world to go back and have one last good senior year before graduating, and I would do anything to have the senior designer that was originally training me back.

Do you think that Proactive Customer Service is essential?,"How could it be that just 13% of 6000 customers reported receiving proactive customer support?¬†

Clearly, lots of service organizations are failing here. And there are many challenges to providing proactive service that cause this failure. But the three big ones are:

* Lack of executive, managerial, and/or employee understanding and/or buy-in.
* Improperly equipped and/or trained customer service reps.¬†
* Failure to create a proactive customer service culture.

## 1-What is proactive customer service?

You know proactive customer service when you see it.  


If you‚Äôve ever gone in for an oil change (hopefully) you‚Äôve seen proactive customer service. Typically, the auto shop inspects your vehicle as part of their oil change service. This allows them to identify issues you might not know about, preventing more costly damage to your car. That‚Äôs proactive customer service.  


The academic definition of proactive customer service is:¬†

>*An individual‚Äôs self-started, long-term oriented, and persistent service behavior that goes beyond explicitly prescribed performance requirements.*¬†  


In the auto shop example, it‚Äôs the organization that created the policy, but the concept is the same. Ideally, both individual actions and organizational policies align to enact proactive customer service.  


### Proactive vs. reactive customer service

Reactive customer service looks like agents who do what they‚Äôre told (and nothing more).¬†  


Reactive customer service means solving the issue of the moment, not necessarily the underlying problem. Reactive service providers might follow directions well, but when something they haven‚Äôt been explicitly trained to handle pops up, they‚Äôll need help.¬†  


This is also a very narrow view of the customer journey. Reactive customer support tends to focus on only the customer service issues directly in front of the support team, rather than pay attention to all of the areas where customers encounter problems and need to resolve issues.  


A common indication that a customer service team is very reactive is when customers have to call in several times to solve the same problem. This isn‚Äôt a great customer experience and can result in consequences ranging from unhappy customers, to customer churn, to increased call center costs.  


## 2-Benefits of proactive customer support

Taking a proactive approach to your customer experience ‚Äî across customer calls, customer service tickets, and how you support new customers ‚Äî can lead to many benefits:  


**Dramatically reduce customer calls.** By proactively communicating the solutions to common customer services issues, you can reduce overall support requests significantly.  


**More loyal customers.** Exceptional customer service earns lasting customer loyalty. Proactive customer service offers more opportunities to resolve customer issues than reactive support.  


**Increase customer retention rates.** Providing proactive support helps you prevent problems that would otherwise go unnoticed, causing customers to churn.  


**More brand advocates.** In addition to improving customer retention rates, proactive support can also delight customers to the point of creating brand evangelists, bolstering the brand‚Äôs reputation, and helping recruit future customers.  


**Better customer data.** Proactive customer service often results in better customer interactions, leaving customers more open to participating in the ways you gather feedback, such as with a feedback form or survey, so that customer service teams can better understand customer behavior.

You can find more solutions to approaching making your proactive customer service better in your organization [here](https://www.hugo.team/blog/proactive-customer-service)!

Teknion hiSpace Quick Connect Electric Height-Adjustable Table,"Just put together my new Teknion standing desk (the hiSpace Quick Connect Electric Height-Adjustable Table) delivered yesterday. I ordered this one because my Toronto den is way too small for a full 48"" Fully desks, but 42"" was too small. Teknion had a 46"" desk that I measured as fitting perfectly in my space. I'm very happy with this table!! Relatively quiet motor and smooth movement. Beautiful finish and I'm very happy with the range of height motion for short people like myself. I worried it'd be too wide as it is 29"" depth but it's the perfect comfortable size for me. I've been using it at the 22.5"" height since I'm 5'3"". 

Just a heads up I had a friend help me make it (it's got very heavy pieces). It took us about 3 hours because the written instruction manual is not as helpful. BUT it comes with a QR code to a more accurate video on installation. The only thing the video didn't contain was the accessory assembly and how to put on the snake cord cover for the main wire that operates the whole table. There were no grommets on the desk for wires or plugs. I'm not sure if the desk can be customized beyond the colour and size, but it doesn't bother me at all.

I ordered it in provincial oak tabletop with white legs. They don't have very good pictures of the different wood effect surfaces, and I couldn't find reviews online, so I had to guess if it would work with my IKEA Kallax shelf in the walnut effect light gray. It's almost perfect! You can see the pictures of my shelf and the table right next to each other. I took the pictures with dimmer light and then with a brighter desk light.

&#x200B;

I am SO glad I went with provincial oak -- it couldn't have been a better match! I almost ordered coastal elm but that would have been way too light and more yellow/less neutral. It's so hard to tell though without proper pictures on their website to give you context for the different lighting.

I'm really happy with the purchase, though it was an expensive one. This was worth it to me to find something I love to use every day. I'm no longer cramped in my workspace and still able to fit it in my relatively small den.

Also I'm using a used Teknion grey Contessa Chair that I just got from a used furniture store in Mississauga. I had never heard of Teknion before a couple months ago and wasn't able to find any real reviews or information on their products online. But I'm really glad I took the chance on their stuff because they seem like good quality products.

Vendor A/R Hell,"Backstory:

Bookkeeper, responsible for maintaining the books for ten locations of a major North American fast food pizza joint.

Client's vendor sends me an email last week about unpaid invoices. This particular vendor's A/R department is notorious around my office for being generally idiots. We have to send an email with a payment confirmation from our client's financial institution of the invoice being paid, a screen shot of the Payments module in our bookkeeping software, in which they can see that the invoice is being paid, and include in the both the subject line and the body of the e-mail the invoice number, the amount of the invoice, and the amount being paid. (Seriously, I'm not making this up.)

A/R: ""Your client has multiple invoices outstanding, dating back to July.""

Me: ""Every one of these invoices has been paid. Here is the entire collection of general ledger entries, online banking payment confirmations, and previous emails - with replies from vendor's A/R department - to prove that these have been paid.""

A/R: ""Oh, excellent - I'll note that these invoices have been paid. Thank you very much.""

Are you being as Direct as you can be at work?,"Directness is a valuable skill that everyone should have, but most people aren't direct because it can be uncomfortable.

More commonly, people are passive aggressive. That, or they'll gossip, hoping word will reach someone instead of going to them directly with their complaint or criticism.

Most of us don't like the idea of directness, even if we actually appreciate it. We don't like the feeling that we might be attacked. When we perceive a message as too direct, we're likely to become defensive.

>Being direct with others is about sharing your feelings in a timely and appropriate way

But when done well, being direct puts issues out in the open for everyone to consider. It's a faster and more productive way to communicate.

The key to being direct at work is to communicate in clear, concise, and rational terms, assertively, but not angrily.

## Why you need to be direct at work

To work for a company as a long-term career, you need to be able to speak directly about your position, ideas, and opinions.

Especially in meetings with your team, being direct makes it easier for people to provide advice and feedback on the situation. Directness gives them an opportunity to help you because they know specifically where the issue is. It saves everyone time because you're saying what you really mean.

Being [direct](https://www.hugo.team/blog/how-to-be-direct-at-work) allows you to have a better relationship with your coworkers and your manager. When there are problems at work, you can clear them up, rather than letting them linger. And your meetings can be shorter.

Can this get more toxic? (Seeking advice),"Greetings, fellas!  
Let me introduce myself and then take you into the traumatizing part.

  
**THE STORY**: I'm an MBA campus fresher (graduated in summer, 2021) working as a consultant in a well known IT company. Managed to convert my very first campus job interview and landed up here. Joined the company in the month of July and it was WFH till September. I was told by my manager that I should report to Client's office (in another city) and this was not even a week in advance. Then I had to ask him (ended up in a little spat) to give some reasonable amount of time. And somehow I won the argument and got finally moved to the new city. I started working from the client's place (as the same is mandated by our company) and everything went smooth for a month's time. 

My manager called me one Sunday morning and requested me to support another project (the other project he leads) for this Sunday alone as they are having a tough time meeting the deadlines. I accepted as that was the very first favor my manager ever asked me. But since then he calls me on every Friday evening to book my availability for the weekend to support that another project. I couldn't say NO and basically got into this trap. I have been working on like this for 2 months without any weekly offs. When I was already pretty pissed at this routine, he wanted to report to this other project's client location which is in the other end of the city. It took me 5 hours commutation (to and fro) when I did for one day. That day I lost my temper and had a very open discussion with my manager that I can't work in 2 projects and why don't you make the people in that another project responsible instead of pressurizing me. He was like ""This how the industry works...we gotta pitch in other projects as well in times of distress...The consultant here are not very well performing..."" And I said why don't you replace them or get people from free pool (a term used to refer to the people who are not assigned to any projects). He kept mum and didn't bother me much to work in that project anymore. But he promised me that he will give me compensatory leaves for the all the weekends that I have worked.

Now for a week's time I'm peacefully working in my own project and they are expecting me to work literally 24\*7 and on weekends too. I go to client's place at 9.30 and work there till 6. They still expect me to go back to my room and connect again (bloody VPN). I am starting to hate this project for mainly 3 reasons...  
1) This is remotely related to the shit I studied in my MBA and literally a high school person can do this with a month's training what I got as a part of the induction program.  
2) The working hours are erratic and I need some me time to prepare for CFA Level 1 (I'm passionate about finance and looking to build a career in investment banking) & other job interviews(yes, I'm actively looking to switch)  
3) The longer I stay in this company, I more I am seen as an IT person which is a drawback if I wanna switch to core finance jobs) 

I have recently applied for 2 compensatory leaves (out of 10) and my manager is pissed that I'm availing them. I was like WTH. I am seeing this pattern where consultants in our domain (esp working under my manager) are resigning. I have come to know that 8 people have resigned in the last 2 months. When I spoke with them, I realized that all are frustrated with the manager, team culture (haphazard manner of assigning consultants randomly in projects other than their own projects, similar to me issue).  


**MY DECISION**: I have decided to switch from this company and am actively looking for other opportunities. I should also prepare for CFA L1 simultaneously. But I'm totally willing to work in this project from 9 to 6.  


**ADVICE REQUIRED:** I don't know how to say NO to the extra working hours. I can't talk to HR as they are also equally toxic. I don't wanna entertain office calls other than my working hours (i.e; 9 to 6). Don't wanna attend calls on weekends too. (Weekends are holidays as per company policy but manager wants us to work because of his inefficiency to manage people) Can't afford to quit now and search for jobs being unemployed.

"My wife's boss approved a schedule she made that had a mistake, and has decided to demote her 3 weeks after his approval.","My wife works in an office and is in charge of scheduling.

They should have replaced Michael with Pam,"Hear me out, the reasons they made Andy Manager are the same reasons why the later seasons are less enjoyable. 

They made Andy Manager because he is the one who most resembled Michael, so they could continue very much on a similar platform. But the thing is - nobody is Michael Scott. 

Pam is objectively the most qualified for the job. When she stepped into the role of Office Administrator she essentially was the covert Office Manager. 

Not only would this have been amazing and realistic character growth going from Receptionist to Manager, but it would also give Pam a chance to go back more into her original comedic role. Which was her reactions to how people interact with her, how people treat her as a female boss and how she reacts to that, the idea that she may be perceived as ‚Äúwearing the pants‚Äù in her marriage, any conflicts of interest where she‚Äôs perceived as favouring Jim more, Dwight being really protective of her when people disrespect her etc. Whilst also giving us some more emotional development, how‚Äôs she going to deal with leading meetings and disciplining others. 

I even think this could have worked with Jenna Fischer‚Äôs pregnancy, how the office deal with having a pregnant boss could have been hilarious.

Coworkers Are Trying to Control Office and Interfering with Work,"Sorry in advanced if this is a bit all over the place. It's just building up worse and worse with no improvement and it's stressing us out.

I've been dealing with a pretty frustrating coworker and their friend since week 2 of me starting this job. It all sparked over staples. We can call the main one Susan and the friend Helen. I have no idea what to do anymore.

Background: I have poor vision so I missed a few staples I dropped and when Helen reminded me to pick up the staples I drop (as I tried to do, but I can't always see them all) I told her ""Okay. I usually try to."" Helen returned 30 seconds later and I repeated the same thing. No anger or frustration or malice about it. I knew she just didn't know about my vision issues. Queue the rest of the day when I'm not doing anything with staples but the other newbie is, and Susan started placing piles of staples that weren't from me onto my desk. When I confronted her and said I didn't appreciate that course of action, Susan yells at me saying I was rude to Helen (which Helen said several times afterwards I wasn't). Ever since then it's been snide comments, making fun of my appearance, throwing things from others clients into my trays (could be HIPAA risk if it isn't one I have access to), and even trying to touch my things, go through my trash/recycling, and open my cabinets. It didn't help matters when Susan was reported for stealing a package mailed to our office by mistake by an old employee, and tried to sell it on FB. She got to stay even though it posed a HUGE risk. They both also read patient information out loud for funsies which could cause us to be penalized for violating HIPAA.

Present: The bullying hasn't stopped. Susan is overreaching by stealing people's food to throw away when she says it unhealthy then insult them for their weight, following me when I am trying to help coworkers get supplies just to tell the coworkers that I'm wrong (never actually talks to me, but will noticeably ignore me and only talk to the coworkers I'm helping), and is now guilting my trainees for using supplies and printers in our room and it's forcing my Trainee to go to other departments to do her print/scan jobs to avoid Susan. Helen is just pretty much a gossip accomplice but praises Susan and helps hide when she does something wrong. They are also both using a cleaner we've pretty much have been told to stop using because it's triggering my asthma and can put me out of work for a few days if I'm breathing in too high of a concentration, as well as causing migraines to several others. Our bosses literally ordered a different cleaner to replace it but they won't change it.

I keep reporting these issues because it's been obvious much of it is unprofessional, unethical, and just uncalled for, but our leadership is just too busy to remember to fix it. Susan and Helen refuse to listen to anyone. They practically play boss when they are at the same level as everyone else, and anyone speaking up about it becomes their next target. Coworkers think HR won't do anything and I'm afraid they're right, as HR is works remote and doesn't witness this behavior.

TL;DR: Coworkers are gossiping and bullying people and are now Interfering with mine and a trainee's work and leadership pretty much isn't doing anything.",Grindminion,qsc1g9,3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/qsc1g9/coworkers_are_trying_to_control_office_and/,office,1636726418.0

Office birthdays ?,Question ‚Ä¶do you participate in office birthdays ? I technically have 2 departments the one that hired me and the office who I physically see everyday .

Supply Storage Question,"I have problems with how the supplies are stored in my office.

For context, I'm 5'4"". I'm average height for a woman. Alot of the supplies are on higher shelves than i can reach. Office kitchenet for example. The coffee (which i don't drink) is kept on a shelf i can just barely reach, and the tea and hot chocolate (which i do) is kept on the shelf above. I need to drag a chair over to reach it, which I find mortifying, so i find myself just not using it. Some of the printer paper i can't reach, so i can't print until someone else refills the machine.

I know the guys don't do this on purpose. I know its not malicious. But it kind of hurts that no one thinks of this. There's one other coworker that's my height, and  she's developed the same habits. 

I know i should ask them to reorganize, but i fell like such a burden doing so. Has anyone ever dealt with something like this?",Angytilt,qm1mbc,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/qm1mbc/supply_storage_question/,office,1635966255.0
Who has a problem with keeping their desk from looking like a dump?,"If you're like me, staying organized can be a tough task. That's in all aspects whether its my desk, life, work, school etc. The last couple of years I have tried my best to keep my desk organized because I found that when I was organized at my desk and there wasn't much clutter around I could get a lot more stuff done!

Here are some tips/benefits about keeping organized in your workplace:

## Tips For Staying Organized At The Computer

If you are at your computer, take a moment to [organize](https://www.hugo.team/blog/keeping-your-computer-desk-organized) the items on your desk.

Move any papers that need to be typed into piles organized by priority. Be sure to use separate folders for each type of document you have created so they can be easily found later. If you have printed things out, organize them in separate stacks of what is complete and what needs to be worked on.

Move pens and paper clips into the holder or cup you keep at your desk as well as any post-it notes that need to be used.

When you finish your work, make sure that everything is put away in its correct location on your desk.

A cluttered computer desk will prevent you from working quickly or efficiently because you can't find things that are necessary for work.

Stay organized at the computer to avoid wasting time searching for items.

## Tips For Staying Organized While Working From Home

When you work from home, it is easy to get distracted and let things pile up.

Avoid this by making a schedule for yourself so that you know when you will work each day and what tasks you need to focus on. Make sure your desk is clean before starting, and if possible, use a dedicated desk for work, rather than sitting at your kitchen table.

Do not leave any dishes or laundry on your desk, because it will add even more messy items to your desk. If you finish your coffee, finish your snack, or take off your sweatshirt because it has warmed up, take a minute to stand up and put the item where it goes. Moving around a little will probably do you some good.

## Benefits of Staying Organized

Organized people are less stressed and more productive. In the long run, staying organized is a great way to boost your self-confidence and self-esteem.

Organized people have been shown to be better at making decisions because they can see things clearly without getting overwhelmed by clutter.

Organized people also tend to be happier.

Am I being bullied and gaslighted at work?,"I do not give permission for this to be shared anywhere else. 

Ok so, I‚Äôve been working In this office for 8 months now. When I started a junior member of staff was outright bitchy to me because she didn‚Äôt like the fact that I had came in at a position higher than her, despite me having several years of experience in this role and the professional qualifications to back this up. 

I discussed this to management at the time who has conversations with everyone to basically tell them that it wouldn‚Äôt be tolerated. 

Well it went from straight up bitchy comments to sly digs and undermining me wherever possible. And a few more
Joined in - like a clique formed and because I wasn‚Äôt in it, I was against it. 

After seeing how another colleagues dispute played out, I decided that reporting it again just wasn‚Äôt worth it. The outcome was basically deal with it as adults and if you don‚Äôt like it, find another job. Both involved have now left for other jobs. 

That brings me round to the string of promotions that were given out, to those that I had complained about. Something about their promotions seemed to have stroked their egos and the outright bitchyness came out of the woodworks. Whispers in the office. Being excluded from
Stuff like meetings that I needed to be in. Then planning nights out with the majority of the office. 

So I have handed my notice in at work

Although I am working my notice, management has stated that they thought that it has all calmed down and they were genuinely sorry to hear that I felt this way. 

So another event was planned yesterday where they planned to meet up In secret. Whispers while they planned it. So once I found out I was once again being excluded, I raised this with management who effectively gaslighted me and made me feel like this is my problem. Like I‚Äôm being the awkward one and that we should deal with it like adults. 

Now I might have taken this differently on another occasion, but since I had watched a very similar scenario play out between other colleagues, I can see clearly that it is a toxic work culture and I am almost convinced that  I am being gaalighted by management so that I don‚Äôt raise a formal complaint.

Printer urgent question,"I'm in the process of buying the Xerox WorkCentre 6516 DNI. I already cheched that all the features correspond to what I'm looking for, but the Paper Size here doesn't quite shut my questions up.

Here it says ""Paper Size: Letter"", but I don't know exactly why a printer would be specific to letter. What I need is for it to print A4 and A3 with no problem, but I don't know if this printer can do that.

I hate printers, shopping for them, shopping for their consumable items and getting scammed basically all the time knowing that even if the printer seems a good purchase there is always a catch or some sort of legalized scam. For this I never even tried to understand but know I have to decide which one to buy.

Note: The Xerox WOrkCentre 6516 and the Xerox WOrkCentre 6516 DNI are the same machine but the DNI has wifi, scan to destinations etc. so I'm going with the best model between the two.

I'm also sharing here the commercial paper with more info

How Chill People Manage email (the Optimal Experience),"I have always enjoyed the aesthetics of neatly organised stuff, by category, color, origin. 

So when the moment came that I had to use my Gmail account to communicate with the university and to use it for work, I needed to make a brand new account, just to start off clean.

Do You Practice Employees Performance Assessment at the Workplace,"Assessing employee performance is one of the crucial responsibilities of the managers, HR, and other authorized parties. Employee performance assessment at the workplace is necessary because it helps management assign bonuses, promote, or even demote employees. Also, it helps employers understand employees‚Äô contributions in the workplace or a team. But how to evaluate employee performance? Here are some ways to I have done:

## Peer Assessment

The way your peers see you at work tells a lot about your performance. An employee spends more time with his peers than the boss or manager, etc. That‚Äôs why peer assessment makes an important criterion in the performance assessment for all employees. The peers include group members and team members, etc. For this assessment, you can use questionnaires for the research.

## Self-Assessment

In self-assessment, employees fill up a questionnaire about themselves. They evaluate their performance and behavior at the workplace and their behavior with their colleague. Most people say that self-assessment is not too effective because employees normally get biased here. But you can use self-assessment along with the other performance measurement criteria to assess an employee‚Äôs progress at the workplace.

## Work Quality

Does the employee only do the work to pass his time? What is the quality of his work? Do you often find out mistakes in it? A positive answer to these questions means that the employee is working dedicatedly, which positively impacts their performance. Besides, you can also measure work quality through client feedbacks and their satisfaction level, etc.

## 360-Degree Feedback

360-degree feedback incorporates different assessment criteria such as peer assessment, self-assessment, and superior‚Äôs assessment. This method is considered ideal because it covers all aspects. 360-degree feedback is more reliable. However, it may be a little time-consuming.

## Creativity Level

[Assess employee competencies](https://www.autonomous.ai/ourblog/assess-employees-competencies-5-effective-ways) through their creativity level. For the right performance assessment at the workplace, employees‚Äô creativity must be incorporated. For instance, what potential solution did the employee consider? How did he assess the risk, and what actions did he take to overcome them? An employee with a higher creativity level can work more efficiently and provide better work results.

## Improvement Consistency

Is the employee consistent with his progress? It should not be like he gave excellent results in one project, while his contribution is near to zero in the other project. For making performance assessment better, considering consistency in an employee‚Äôs progress is vital. While deciding on an appraisal or bonus, the employee with higher progress consistency should be preferred.

Changing office setup to be able to see outside,"Currently I work at a small company in a small office building.  I currently sit next to a walkway near the front door (which is a windowed door), but there is a wall between my desk and the front door, so I can't see outside unless I lean sideways to peek around the wall.

Sometimes I think it can be a bit depressing that my desk has no easy way to see outside.  I'm not sure I could move to another desk right now.  I've wondered if it would be okay and reasonable to ask the company owner if he could install a couple of mirrors or something so I'd have a way to see outside?",RolandMT32,q8sxv5,3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/q8sxv5/changing_office_setup_to_be_able_to_see_outside/,office,1634318044.0

Cleaning crew messing up my office and eating my food,"This is an ongoing issue. Someone eats my snacks out of my office. I didn‚Äôt care until they seemingly put their bare hands into my pumpkin seeds and spilled some of them onto my bookcase. Gross. My papers and sticky notes are moved and shuffled around. My office phone was knocked over. My glasses case was flipped over and moved across the room. The items on my desk are moved every night. Apparently others in my office have this issue and started closing their doors but still have the problem. I thought it was a coworker at first and didn‚Äôt say anything as to overreact or something. My understanding is that no one has addressed this with the cleaning crew vendor because you can‚Äôt prove things like this. I also understand ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a big deal.‚Äù I can get past the creepy feeling of someone touching my stuff and eating my food. I just adapt by taking the food away and closing my door. But I do have a big problem with my work items, my glasses, and papers being moved. My desk and office are extremely organized and it‚Äôs frustrating to have to reorganize my papers. I work in a prestigious office that also has inspections by malpractice insurers/ I.T. folks so we can have certain certifications in our field. The policy is that we don‚Äôt let outside guests in our office, lock computers, and have very strict security procedures to protect our clients and the content of our work.

I've complained via the appropriate channel and will probably end up leaving if I have to listen to it all day every day.

If your mobile phone is equipped with a wireless charging function, you only need to place the mobile phone horizontally to charge the mobile phone against the charging area. The same applies to charging through two 120V power outlets and three USB-A ports!

Use the clamps fixed on the table, do not need to punch holes, it is very convenient to fix on the table to prevent sliding. 

It can charge six devices in three different ways to provide solutions for all your charging needs. There is a power socket on each side of the hub, leaving enough space for larger or awkward plugs.

Hospital or Private Practice?,"I've worked as a receptionist in (now) multiple hospitals and the vibe has always had this weird caste system where the patient facing workers would always be kind of treated like bottom of the barrel people. I recently applied to a physical therapy office 5 mins away from where I live, and I've only been working at my new hospital job for a little over a week.

I already hate my new place of employment. Director is super condescending and so is the girl that's training me, and nobody is friendly. I'm already being overworked beyond belief for way higher than my pay grade and I'm wondering if I should just pack my bags.

Since applying at this PT place I've really wanted them to reach out to me, but is working for a private practice a better option or should I just stick to what I have?

Deal with a Creepy Coworker in the Office,"We all grew up hearing the advice 'Listen to your gut' while our gut rarely uses the clear signals to indicate something, sometimes you know when something is wrong. In a workplace, I often have a high sense of alertness because of my high focus on work, so if I sense something out of the ordinary, then I realize it immediately.

From feeling left out of important discussions, not getting enough guidance, being overwhelmed with work, or having a boss with attitude, are all reasons for workplace stress, having a creepy coworker is an issue of its own.

## So, How to Deal with A Creepy Coworker?

Various creepy coworker signs I got from my experience will help you identify whether an employee or sub-ordinate is being their wrong self.

Especially in modern workplaces such as [co-working spaces](https://www.autonomous.ai/ourblog/the-future-of-coworking-space-what-we-need-to-prepare), where there are different employees per shift, it is hard to form an association with everyone. So if you suspect someone being a creepy coworker, Hop this post will help you with it. 

### Talk to Them

Although you wouldn't want this, sometimes people are doing things unknowingly. Maybe they have a friendly nature; they could be extra outgoing while you have a large personal space bubble. If you find that this could all be in your head, talk to them and let them know about the things that make you uncomfortable.

Or, if you find the creepy coworker sitting right beside you, then getting some privacy might help you. Even if you cannot separate the work desks, get a privacy panel to partition you and them.

### Address the Issue

If none of the above tactics work and you find the coworker relatively creepy after this, then make sure you address the issue with the management. They will either make you shift to another team or maybe even inspect the coworker for their unprofessional behavior by speaking up.

That's how to handle in my workplace. How about you? What will you act if you have to work with a creepy colleague.",dandy-2902,ppe690,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/ppe690/deal_with_a_creepy_coworker_in_the_office/,office,1631801836.0

Accidentally said something,"Hey guys. I feel terrible tonight. One of my co-workers is a my best friend at work and a woman and I am a guy.
Today I said something stupid on accident. She is our lead, but not manager, and I put together a small meeting to hash out technical details with a few others about something I brought up with the larger group but didn't thing would apply to anyone else.

The meeting turned out to be a bigger strategy meeting and I felt bad afterwards I didn't invite her. After this, I talked to her about it and said we were talking about technical things about the plan and then basically without realizing it, made her feel like I insinuated it would go over her head.

I respect her probably more than anyone I have ever worked with and think she is so smart and could totally understand, but I was so off today for some stupid reason. she slacked me to tell me this but didn't seem super mad, and I apologized and tried to explain. My slack reaction was of absolute horror that I accidentally said something like that.

I am so not the type of person to intentionally hurt others and I like everyone and am not like this, she and everyone knows this, but I can't get over what will happen tomorrow and if she is okay, so I am kicking myself because I haven't heard back because it is after hours. 

Am I screwed do you think? This could be so bad for the politics of it, but my biggest worry is her feelings and if it ruins our friendship. I really didn't mean how it came out.

Tips on stopping a discourteous coworker.,"There‚Äôs been a reoccurring issue with a coworker for the last few months and my coworker and I are unable to get the issue resolved. 

Due to COVID a majority of our organization was sent to work from home. A few months in, a few staff were allowed to return to the office. My sub-department did not return till April 2021. I share my office with one of my coworkers because we are also technically a separate department and our office has a large copy/printing machine. My coworker did not return to work due to having to be out for leave.
Upon my return, I learned some coworkers where using our printer when other printers were down or backed up. I didn‚Äôt mind at all. However this continued even when I returned and one person would continue to use the printer when I was in the office, on a phone call, meeting etc. What really disturbed me is this person would just walk into my office, wouldn‚Äôt knock or wouldn‚Äôt ask if it was an appropriate time to use the printer. I complained to my supervisors but nothing came of it. 

A couple weeks ago, my coworker returned and for personal reasons, needs privacy at certain times of day. The way our office is set up, I can‚Äôt see her due to filing cabinets so she‚Äôs able to have her privacy even when I‚Äôm in the office. For these times, we put 2 ‚Äúdo not disturb signs‚Äù on our door and we lock the door from the outside. This person continues to send things to print in our office and then walks over to grab her papers. With these signs and the doors being locked she uses a master key (she is not in a managerial or supervisor position) to come in and doesn‚Äôt say a word. 

My coworker is sending her own complaint to our supervisors but I am wondering if there is some device or if there is a hack we can use on the door so this no longer happens?? I‚Äôm hoping our management addresses the issue this time around",samanthaz111,p6y8aq,1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/p6y8aq/tips_on_stopping_a_discourteous_coworker/,office,1629314673.0

"Massive workload and duties differences for same role?? I'm struggling, help!!","Hey guys!
I (23F, ireland) recently got a job in an office. It seems to be largely male dominated but the office manager is a woman. 

A man (let's call him Joe) and myself were both hired at the same time for the same position. However, his workload is much smaller than mine. I monitor all customer support inboxes, calls, live chat, as well as processing returns, releasing new orders, and testing stock. I often get snowed under work and the manager always has a passive aggressive response to my questions or acts annoyed/stressed when I talk to her. When I've made mistakes she's also reacted badly. 

Meanwhile, Joe only tests stock and sometimes covers reception. One day he was meant to take calls also but he set his phone to forward them all to my desk. Nothing was done. At the same time I couldn't physically answer all calls etc and get my queue done. 

3 weeks after I started, another new guy was hired (let's call him Dave). Today I witnessed Dave being trained to release orders which I would normally do. The manager was very kind to him and gave him no deadline to finish just to ""get comfortable with the system"". When I started I was just told to do it and get it done asap. Dave has also been only given one other duty besides ""getting comfortable"". 

TLDR: my male peers' workload is much smaller and they have much less pressure applied to them than I do. When they make mistakes it's brushed off. I'm constantly stressed and rushed and pressured to get a 3-4x larger workload done and my mistakes are treated worse than theirs.


I'm dreading going into work these days because I know how stressed and anxious I'll be all day, especially with passive aggressive treatment from the manager.

How do I (27F) deal with immature colleagues in the office that are the same age?,"Hi, so a bit of background. I‚Äôve worked in a few offices since I was 23. In the same industry so I know my stuff. I have progressed within the industry. 

I started a new job 5 months ago, and a large portion of the office is female aged 25-27. 

I go to work and it feels like I‚Äôm in a playground with the bitching and gossiping. I just want to get on with my job instead of dealing with playground politics. 

Most of this group have less than 6 months in industry and seem to have an attitude problem if I ask them to do something (that is part of their job) or if I tell them a specific task cannot be completed at the time they want to do it (we are in a highly regulated industry and have to play by the rules)
(Just to add. I know that qualifications arent everything, but I am massively more qualified with industry specific qualifications and much more experience than all of them)

The decline of telework,"In the midst of telework last year, our agency head implied we would be able to keep teleworking indefinitely after the pandemic. Suddenly a couple months ago we were told that full time telework would not be allowed at all (even with typical medical exemptions like ""high risk"") and we had to be in the office at least 2 days a week (any 2 days). When questioned on it the agency head claimed he never said we'd do this forever. This week an email was sent out by our department manager that we would soon be moving to being in the office 3 days a week. This leaves only two days to telework, fewer for those doing 9 or 10 hour schedules.

Also this week at least one employee had his telework agreement revoked just to meet a deadline. Ironically he had to take sick leave instead of working from home when he got sick and didn't want to risk spreading anything to coworkers, and consequently the deadline was not met.

Unfortunately all these events make it seem like management has soured on teleworking, period. This is a public agency, so tends to be a little more backwards. But nothing we do really requires being in the office, other than obscure ""face-to-face meetings."" Collaboration has worked quite well on Microsoft Teams. How do we as lower level employees encourage management to change direction? I can't see making this a union issue, as not all union jobs are equal, some more customer facing ones may need people in the office. But before 2020 we always supposedly had telework options but it was never approved for most people. The latest guidelines reduced the number of days required in office, but it looks like we are trending back towards telework not being approved. Today it's 2 days, in the near future 3 days, soon after that it would be easy to push for 4 or 5 days in the office and we're back to being tied down. Leaving is certainly an option... But that also has tradeoffs like working in the private sector and the added stress that comes with it.",macsare1,oqciz7,7,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/oqciz7/the_decline_of_telework/,office,1627077446.0

Summer in the office,"So... Working over the summer in an office is an experience and a half and I'd say so far, July has offered a ton of firsts for me as a fairly new office-worker. Our office is located in an ""Office Hotel"" where several businesses rent office space. I thought I'd share some summer-stories from our little corner of the office world.

Our 6-man admin office is H.O.T. in the humid summer and we're all slowly melting as we type away on our keyboards, making sure the business is kept running even as clients, business partners ect. are all on vacation, though somehow they still manage to send us invoices.

I had to disturb my supervisor on the first day of her summer vacation, because the big boss wanted to know if we had billed a customer some money for a consultant and what months we hadn't charged for this past year and I had no clue where to check that.

Last week the coffee-maker on our floor broke down and was out of comission for 4 days. As an office worker, I am of course addicted to caffeine, otherwise the numbers just don't come out right and the keys on my keyboard start magically moving, like they're playing musical chairs - Keyboard edition.

Right after lunch today I managed to break the industrial printer, and since I'm the new kid with a ton of typing-work to do in a database, we're setting up, I'm stuck at the very very VERY hot office, hoping a technician will call and say he can fix it today (so I can actually do meaningful work tomorrow). This is the largest item that has stopped working after I touched it. Maybe I'll share that list some other time, but let's just say that I've been a bit of a destructive force when it comes to the equipment here in the office.

Those are just a few of the things that happens in the office over the sumnmer. I hope this wasn't too tedius a read.

"Syncing ""back to office"" moments","I work in a small (10ish) IT consulting company. Even before covid started we worked part-time in office/at home. Since Covid restriction are now being lifted in our area, some people are going back to the office (although less regularly). However with such a small workforce and 2 offices it is uncertain  who will be in the office when. I think it could be very advantageous to know which colleagues will be in the office when: 

1) Since our office is not big enough to seat everybody we would know when it would be too crowded

2) You know when to go to the office to catch up with a certain colleague (Or to avoid them ;-) )

 So I was looking for a solution that is easy to use, low-effort. There should be almost no boundaries to enter a location status (preferable a (few) day in advanced). In the past we looked at creating calendar event and sharing this to everybody else, but it didn't seem to catch on (I assume it was to convoluted to look at everybody's agenda all he time, to much effort to add every day in there...). 

Do anybody know an easy system to achieve the above?",TAhnogmealso,ok3npd,3,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/ok3npd/syncing_back_to_office_moments/,office,1626266969.0

We're completely out of our depth with project management options. Any advice on getting started?,"I work for a very small office public facing office has a large client base. We have a busy season that requires us to collaborate & process work quickly.

We find that we've suddenly outpaced our current processes and need to catch up to the modern era.  It seems like everything I find QUICKLY outpaces my understanding, though. I'm in a loop where I don't understand what terms to search for, and I find things like ""eliminate silos with 360 viewing,"" which just sounds like buzzwords to me.  

Last year, we made our first step and got a drop box through Citrix. Getting that going wasn't too painful, and I guess it made me over confident. I'm completely out of my depth now trying to investigate 2 options, Workspace & Wrike. 

I'm looking at these because they're with Citrix, and I felt it would be easier to adapt if we stick with programs that have a similar feel, but I'm not sold on them if anyone has suggestions! I'm coming to reddit because I've talked to my sales rep 3 times now but I'm no further along. During the call about Workspace I got completely lost in the jargon and can't even understand the questions they're asking me.  (They're sending a list of requirements that I can share with the outside IT rep we use, but it doesn't make sense to ask him to decide for me if this does what I want.)

Does anyone use Workspace and/or Wrike? Do you like it? Do you use anything else you would recommend instead? 

&#x200B;

If anyone is so patient, here's a summary of what I'm mainly trying to achieve. 

\-We need to be able to share calendars

\-We'd like to do better on time tracking

\-We need better tools to be able to pass files between employees & management while adding notes/corrections/approvals without bogging down our email.  (Right now, we save docs to a server and only one person can be editing a file at a time. It's madness)

\-We lack a good client management system. I need something that functions as a database where I can search clients by name, view contact info, and quickly scan recent notes (IE, a client calls and says the owner told them XYZ, I want to check for his notes.) 

\-We use a random assortment of tools like TeamViewer & they require us to set up individual workstations with dual monitors in our physical office just so that 100% remote employees can connect from home and have their dual monitors work properly. We don't mind having individual pc's in office if that's what we need to do, but 2 monitors on each-?! My vague understanding of Workspace is that it will work with our server to allow people to remote connect to a virtual machine from anywhere and that it would completely replace TeamViewer or a need for a VPN option.",recyclethislogin,oguhm5,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/oguhm5/were_completely_out_of_our_depth_with_project/,office,1625833549.0

Scheduling Software,"Hello!  Small Medical Office Biz Manager here... We use a third-party billing company for insurance claims.... but I need a better way to keep up with scheduling and how much the client owes at each visit. I get the financial information from my billing company, but my current software doesn't allow for extra information to be added so I have to keep up with it separately, which is a huge hassle. (Current software is a free app not made for a medical office, so name and appt time is all I can use.)

I would like something that can schedule clients on a one-time or recurring basis, with places for the copay/deductible/other owed amounts, and a spot to list their current insurance company so I don't have to look it up each time to verify eligibility. I'd like all of this on a ""click and view"" option directly from the calendar, instead of having to go all the way into a client profile to see it. Anything that is relatively similar will be looked into. 

Cost is another factor... I'm finding these things are rather pricey on a monthly basis. Since I'm not doing billing services (honestly just scheduling, I create my own invoices as needed) we don't need to pay for *alltheservices*. Any ideas? Websites to check out?

Managing Meetings While Returning to the Office,"**First Call: A Retrospective on Meetings**

Under most circumstances, you should never have a meeting about a meeting. Such a blunder usually indicates you‚Äôre not prepared.

This time it‚Äôs different.

An excellent first step for any recurring meeting you have is to add a quick retrospective to the agenda.

The first item should be a discussion of how the meeting itself has evolved during the WFH period and how it could be modified, shortened, or even eliminated now that you‚Äôre back in the office.¬†

It makes sense to take 15 minutes on this for every regular meeting on your calendar. After all, if you shorten the meeting time, eliminate the meeting, or reduce its frequency, you‚Äôll easily make that time back.¬†

**Shorter and Fewer Meetings**

Time spent in meetings is time away from producing work, so it‚Äôs worth reducing the amount of time spent in in-person meetings, conference calls, and virtual meetings if it‚Äôs not productive.¬†

The two trajectories are reducing the number of meetings on your calendar and reducing the length of the meetings.¬†

Some simple hints for reducing meeting invites and [meeting](https://www.hugo.team/blog/manage-meeting-schedule) length include:

* Require all meetings to have an agenda and a purpose. Make it a company policy that any meetings without an agenda are automatically canceled.
* Do follow-ups on the tasks and action items before the next meeting so that the team doesn‚Äôt have to rehash what happened in the previous meetings.
* Use asynchronous communication for status and routine updates.
* Create short templates and questionnaires for people to fill out prior to the meeting. Use simple and pointed questions such as ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs one thing you‚Äôre stuck on this week?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs one area where you want feedback from the team?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs one big win you had this week?‚Äù

**Asnyc: Keep It Going**

Working from home made all of us experts in asynchronous communications. E-mail, chat, voice, and asynchronous video platforms aren‚Äôt going anywhere. Maintain working practices that have helped your company function well during the period of remote work.¬†

If an asynchronous method is working well, keep it in place. There may be a desire or temptation to move to in-person meetings but resist. Meetings are expensive.",Odd-Bluebird2523,oaaxnq,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/oaaxnq/managing_meetings_while_returning_to_the_office/,office,1624981581.0

Fired in the cruelest manner,"My boss fired me in the cruelest way. It was protracted over 4 months of ""improvement"" conversations.

I am well-regarded in my field and have gotten a more prestigious job since the firing. I'm appreciated at my new workplace.

She was not interested in seeing facts but in justifying her opinion. We are in journalism, so you would think facts would matter.

I had 2 children in college at the time, but after 10 (award-winning) years at this employer, I was offered no severance. The statements of contempt about me and my work were devastating.

Do you struggle with staying in shape?,"Hey guys, I 'm currently doing some research about **people who are working most of their time at a desk**. I also prepared 2 simple questions and I would be very glad if you could take a few minutes of your time.

1. What are your 2 biggest issues your struggling with losing weight or staying in shape with your work?
2. Regarding to your struggle, what thing are you wishing for the most?

Thanks in advance and have a nice day.",Silassas,k6hc46,9,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/k6hc46/do_you_struggle_with_staying_in_shape/,office,1607071976.0
Virtual holiday office party,"2020 has been a trying year for everyone. The future is uncertain and many people are facing difficulties with feeling disconnected, isolated, or disengaged. I know I'm feeling meeting fatigue and missing the spontaneity and serendipity that comes with working in the office. 

For the last couple of months, I've been using a [Sophya](https://sophya.ai) virtual workspace in my part-time job and that lack of connection that I've been feeling went away. Interactions with my team felt much more natural,  more fun, and closer to what work was like pre-pandemic. 

Yesterday, a lightbulb went off in my head - we could use Sophya to host a holiday gathering for our team! We're stoked to be using it and I couldn't help but share this if anyone else could be saved from a crappy office party.",noble_strawberry,k4062r,8,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/k4062r/virtual_holiday_office_party/,office,1606756632.0

Looking for a durable document holder/folder!,"Recently I‚Äôve been on the hunt for a document holder or folder that‚Äôs going to last me a while. For folders it seems like I can only find the cheap plastic ones that are targeted towards school kids. And document holders are either accordion style, which I don‚Äôt like, or are made out of expensive materials like leather. I‚Äôd rather not break bank on a document holder. I‚Äôm hoping to spend no more than $20 on it, but I‚Äôm pretty flexible!! Any recommendations??",cuprea,ilinbs,5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/ilinbs/looking_for_a_durable_document_holderfolder/,office,1599091132.0

A Healthier Office,"  Hello fellow office workers,

I don‚Äôt know about you, but working at my desk all day led to some concerning health problems lately: obesity and lower back pain. Forgot to mention that I‚Äôm only 34.

Anyway, I wanted to share with you some resources on how to make your office life healthier:

* [Standing desk benefits.](https://iworkstanding.com/standing-desk-benefits/)
* [Correct desk height calculator](https://iworkstanding.com/sitting-standing-desk-height-chart/)
* [Active sitting](https://iworkstanding.com/standing-desk-chair-stool/)

How to keep the fun going in isolation?,"Hi from Australia!

In the office, I am normally the person in charge of the *Fun* activities that keeps things from getting tedious... like event days, fun Friday drinks... bingo... hot seat prizes...

We work in a call centre, so when we don't have calls - we are talking to eachother.

Now we are all home, it's hard and I know we all feel isolated from our usual chats.. unfortunately we can't video call all day As we are working on the phones. 

How can I make a Fun Activity while isolating?

Does anyone have any ideas that they could share please? I just want to bring some fun back!

Thank you!",queenclumsy,g4ghop,10,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/g4ghop/how_to_keep_the_fun_going_in_isolation/,office,1587334103.0
